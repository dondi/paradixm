<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

<blockquote><p>Across nearly all platforms, checkboxes are virtually identical. This component's simplicity prevents it from having a wide variety of designs.</p><p> The appearance of a checkbox mirrors the real-world checkbox, which makes a mental model blatant. </p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This component has many states across most platforms: checked, unchecked, disabled, and pressed down. Like a button, these different states should be obvious in the event that someone clicks (or holds down) on it. The two states that are most important, however, and checked and unchecked. This allows the user to designate the statement next to the checkbox as either true or false. </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Events</h4>

<blockquote>A checkbox can be checked or unchecked as the result of a click. Additionally, checkboxes represent the event of an item in a list. A simple example of this representation is a to-do list, which showcases whether a certain task has been completed.</blockquote>

<p>The most relevant button event is the <code>click</code>. A <code>click</code> event indicates that the user has switched the checkbox's state. Secondary events include <code>hover</code>, indicating that a pointing device is explicitly within the button’s bounds. In the event that a user presses and holds on a checkbox, the <code>release</code> event is applicable.</p>

<h4>State Diagram</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following diagram shows the six states of a standard checkbox and the events/actions that cause each state to change. </p>

<p>
Most checkbox designs have the following states: the <code>checked (enabled)</code> , <code>checked (disabled)</code> , <code>unchecked (enabled)</code> , and <code>unchecked (disabled)</code> states. The <code>disabled</code> checkboxes can be viewed as “dormant” checkbox states—they are the only states that a checkbox can have when a user is not interacting with the checkbox, and is not permitted to do so either. In contrast, the <code>enabled</code> states means that a user <em>can</em> interact with them.
</p>

<p>In most cases, if a button is not <code>disabled</code>, a <code>click</code> action will cause the checkbox to change states from <code>checked</code> to <code>unchecked</code> or vice-versa.</p>

<p>The other two states occur when a user invokes the <code>press</code> event. These states are <code>checked (held)</code> and <code>unchecked (held)</code>. Upon <code>release</code>, the checkbox enters the corresponding state, either <code>checked</code> or <code>unchecked</code>.


<h3>Variants</h3>
<h4>Radio Buttons and Switches</h4>
<center>
<img src="../check-box/funnySwitch.gif" style="width:125px;height:100px;">
</center>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deviations from the original checkbox include both radio buttons and switches. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><em>Radio Buttons</em>
  A radio button has a different design but conveys nearly the same information by being able to be either selected or unselected. Traditionally, radio buttons are used when only one option from a list of options is able to be selected at a time. Another way of saying this is that radio buttons are used when the choices are mutually exclusive, while checkboxes are more often used when the choices are not mutually exclusive.

<div class="radio">
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="optionsRadios" id="optionsRadios1" value="option1" checked>
    This radio button will become deselected when you...
  </label>
</div>
<div class="radio">
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="optionsRadios" id="optionsRadios2" value="option2">
    Select this radio button. And vice-versa.
  </label>
</div>
  </li>

  <li><em>Switch Buttons</em>
      The switch button also has two primary states: on and off. The switch, also known as a toggle, changes state also by a <code>click</code>, however, is usually used to enact an action rather than mark a statement as true or false.
      <div><img src="../check-box/toggle.gif" style="width:120px;height:95px;"></div>
      <div>This gif of a switch represents ON and OFF states by changing color.</div>
  </li>

  <h3>Component in Action</h3>
  <p>
  See the checkboxes below to interact with some basic checkboxes!
    <div class="checkbox">
    <label>
      <input type="checkbox" value="">
      The checkbox in all its <code>enabled</code> glory.
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="checkbox disabled">
    <label>
      <input type="checkbox" value="" disabled>
      The mysterious <code>disabled</code> checkbox.
    </label>
  </div>

<h3>When to Use What Widgets</h3>
<p>
    Ever since the first edition of <cite> Inside Macintosh </cite> in 1984, the rule has been the same for when to use checkboxes versus radio buttons. All subsequent GUI standards and the official W3C Web standards have included the same definition of these two controls:</p>
<ol>
    <li style="margin-top: 1ex">
        <strong>Radio buttons </strong> are used when there is a list of two or more options that are <strong> mutually exclusive </strong> and the user must select exactly one choice. In other words, clicking a non-selected radio button will deselect whatever other button was previously selected in the list.</li>
    <li style="margin-top: 1ex">
        <strong>Checkboxes </strong> are used when there are lists of options and the user may <strong> select any number </strong> of choices, including zero, one, or several. In other words, each checkbox is independent of all other checkboxes in the list, so checking one box doesn't uncheck the others.</li>
    <li style="margin-top: 1ex">
        <strong>A stand-alone checkbox </strong> is used for a single option that the user can choose by marking the statement as true or false.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

<blockquote>
  Because checkboxes are so intuitive for users, all usability metrics are applicable, with efficiency and memorability being the most significant.
</blockquote>

<p>Because checkboxes are such a fundamental part of so many user interfaces available today, it can be said that all usability metrics are equally important for this component. Users who are seeing a checkbox in a given platform for the first time must not have any issues recognizing it and knowing what to do with it (learnability). The high priority of learnability also implies that memorability is a given.</p>

<p>Users must also never experience undue delays with using a checkbox (efficiency), particularly because using a checkbox almost always involves an instantaneous, immediate-result action. Users should almost never trigger a checkbox by mistake (errors)—especially checkboxes whose actions result in significant changes to data or the real world. Additionally, because checkboxes are commonly used in lists, the user usually needs to submit the list, using a button.</p>

<p>If any metric at all can be considered as a “low priority” for checkboxes, it would be satisfaction. The checkbox is such a utilitarian component that “joy” or “uncontrollable excitement” is hardly associated with its use. One exception to this prioritization may be for checkboxes in applications whose primary metric is satisfaction (e.g. video games, entertainment platforms).
As a part of that overall system, making checkboxes “pleasurable” may then become more important than in other situations.</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

<blockquote>
  So what makes for a good <em>checkbox</em>?
</blockquote>
<p>
According to Apple, a checkbox is a type of button that lets the user choose between two opposite states, actions, or values. They also provide some guidelines for how they want checkboxes implemented:
<ul>
  <li>Provide a title that implies two opposite states</li>
  <li>Use a checkbox in a view, not a window frame</li>
  <li>Use a radio button when the user needs to choose between more than two states</li>
  <li>Consider using a label to introduce a group of checkboxes if their relationship isn't evident</li>
  <li>In general, arrange multiple checkboxes vertically</li>
  <li>Use alignment and indentation to group related checkboxes</li>
  <li>Enable and disable checkboxes and related controls accordingly</li>
  <li>Use a mixed state when it makes sense</li>
</ul>
  <br>
  According to Google, a checkbox can either be a primary action or secondary action, and desktop checkboxes should appear only on <code>hover</code> and <code>focus</code>.
  </p>
  <center>
  <img src="../check-box/googleChecklist.png" style="width:411.5px;height:288px;">
  </center>
  <p>
  In the image above, the checkbox is the primary action and the state indicator for the list item.
  </p>
  <br>
    <p>
    According to Microsoft, one should limit the number of checkboxes in the user interface. If one needs to include several options, consider using a list view or list box control instead.
    In addition, one should:
    <ul>
      <li>Label all checkboxes</li>
      <li>Use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb226821(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank">sentence caps</a> for checkbox labels</li>

<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>Much like a button, it is important for checkboxes to give instant feedback. Users must
  never doubt whether:</p>

<ol>
  <li>they have checked a box, or selected an option. </li>
  <li>they have successfully unchecked a box, or in the case of switches, successfully disabled an action. </li>
</ol>

    <h3>Guidelines</h3>
     <p>
        Windows 10 follows the below guidelines outlined by the most recent Windows developer guidelines found <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/checkbox">here</a>.
        These guidelines include, but are not limited to:
        <ul>
        <li>checkbox text is on two lines or less. </li>
        <li>The label must be worded as a statement that the checkmark designates as true. </li>
        <li>Don’t put two checkbox groups next to each other without a clear label to separate them.</li>
        <li>If there are mutually exclusive statements in a checkbox list, use radio buttons instead.</li>
        <li>Checkboxes should not be used to perform or control a command, use a toggle instead.</li>
        <li>Checking a box should not cause a display or control to be displayed.</li>
        <li> The indeterminate state should be used when the user is able to see the sub-choices.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Examples of checkbox Use </h3>
      <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>
          Although the choice is said to be binary, Windows 10 actually allows for a checkbox to be in three (not two) states: selected, unselected, and indeterminate. Indeterminate is used when the choice is composed of both selected and unselected sub-choices. The indeterminate checkbox is very rarely used, likely because it is confusing for the user. For example, A checkbox in the indeterminate state is shown in the screen shot to the right. The checkbox is filled with a square. If the user clicks on the square, the square disapears. If the user clicks on the box again, a checkmark appears, and if the user clicks a third time, the box reappears.
          </p>
          <p>
          Checkboxes are commonly used to mark a statement as either true or false, and in cases where the indeterminate is allowed, a naive user is unsure of what they are marking the statement as when indeterminate is an option. This example of the indeterminate seems to violate the Microsoft guidelines above because the sub-choices are not visible.

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>
          Microsoft defines the appropriate time to use a checkbox for a yes/no choice instead of a toggle as when the checkbox designates a status rather than causing an immediate action.
        </p>
        <p>
          The screenshot to the right shows a single checkbox being used in Windows 10. When the box is checked,  a status is saved but there is no immediate action. The action instead happens when the form is submitted by clicking a button at the bottom of the window.
          Other examples include agreeing to a terms of service agreement and a “Remember me?” box when logging in.

        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <p>
            Another difference between toggles and checkboxes is that only checkboxes are used for multi-selection. The choices cannot be mutually exclusive (in that scenario, a radio button would be appropriate).
            The below screenshot shows multiple checkboxes being used in Windows 10. The checkboxes allow the user to select which days the alarm will repeat on. The days of the week are selected with checkboxes, but to turn the alarm itself on or off, a toggle is used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Multiple checkboxes can also be used when selecting folders or files in the file explorer. This allows the user to designate files and folders to do some other action to. The check marks them as selected, and then the user is able to perform actions such as move, delete and copy to all of the selected items at once.

        <blockquote>
            This version of the Mac operating system debuted in October of 2015, but kept many of the stylistic design choices that came out with Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks. One of the big changes came with the addition to the Notes app that allows users to turn a list into a checklist, which makes use of the checkbox component.
        </blockquote>
        <h4>Mac OS X Design Principles</h4>
            <h5>Mental Model</h5>

                <p>
                "A mental model is the concept of an object or experience that people carry in their heads."<br>
                Apple believes that it is important to acknowledge the mental models that people bring with them, since those models influence their expectations.<br>
                In the case of the checkbox component, many users' mental models are inspired by the fact that people use checklists in their daily lives, and are therefore familiar with what the checkbox represents and what it means for a checkbox to be enabled.
                <center>
                <img src="../check-box/elCapitanChecklist.jpg" style="width:707px;height:493px;">
                </center>
                The screenshot above illustrates how Mac OS X El Capitan takes advantage of this mental model that many users have. Many users use notepads to keep track of to-do lists, and so the new Notes application makes it easy for one to convert a list into a checklist. Note that the checkbox icons are designed in a way that makes it easy for one to tell which ones are enabled.
                </p>

            <h5>Explicit &amp; Implied Actions</h5>
                <p>
                According to Apple, a typical action involves three steps:
                <ol>
                  <li>Identify an object onscreen </li>
                  <li>Select or designate the object </li>
                  <li>Perform an action, either by invoking a command or by direct manipulation of the object </li>
                </ol>
                These steps lead to the two "paradigms for manipulating objects: explicit actions and implied actions."
                For checkboxes, the explicit action paradigm applies, since one of the key characteristics of a checkbox is that a label is supplied with the checkbox, which explicitly tells the user why the checkbox is being used.
                <center>
                    <img src="../check-box/systemPrefCheckbox.png" style="width:780px;height:739px;">
                </center>
                The screenshot above highlights the use of a clearly described checkbox. In Mac OS X, the checkbox is most commonly seen in the preference panes of applications, probably due to the customizable nature of a preference panel. In addition, one can see that this label does not confuse the reader, making it clear that a checked box will cause the operating system to "automatically hide and show the menu bar."
                </p>

            <h5>User Control</h5>
                <p>
                This principle presumes that the user should initiate and control actions. However, Apple admits this can be challenging for the following reasons:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The ideal user experience lies somewhere between expecting users to provide instructions for every step of every action and preventing users from initiating any but the most basic actions </li>
                      <li>The right amount of user control depends on the sophistication of the user audience </li>
                    </ul>
                    <center>
                    <img src="../check-box/disabled.png" style="width:780px;height:654px;">
                    </center>
                The screenshot shown here illustrates an example where checkboxes are disabled, thus taking the control away from the user. In this case, this was done as a matter of security, since the user must first "unlock" the panel by inputting his/her account information.
                </p>
            <h5>Consistency</h5>
                <p>
                Obviously, consistency is one of the most important principles, especially when thinking about the usability metrics of memorability, efficiency, and errors. Apple also believes that consistency in the interface "allows users to transfer their knowledge and skills from one app to another."<br>
                This does not mean that each application needs to looks and behave just as every other application does. Instead, an application should "respect its users and avoid forcing them to learn new ways to do things for no reason than to be different."
                    <center>
                    <img src="../check-box/checkboxVsRadio.png" style="width:662px;height:556px;">
                    </center>
                The image above is taken from a preferences panel in the Mail application. Note that the checkboxes for the past three "settings-based" examples have used the same checkbox component. This makes it easy for a user to recognize that a checkbox will have the same behavior throughout the operating system. Next one will see how this does principle does not always apply when the concept of aesthetic integrity comes into play.
                </p>
            <h5>Aesthetic Integrity</h5>
                <p>
                Apart from consistency, one must also be thinking about how the "visual and behavioral design of an app is consistent with the content and tasks it presents." This means that the checkbox does not always need to be that classic blue checkbox when it does not flow with the application's purpose.
                    <center>
                    <img src="../check-box/remindersCheckboxes.png" style="width:628px;height:612px;">
                    </center>
                The image above showcases this principle, as the reminders app is meant for seeing what has been done, not what is selected.

      <h3>About "System 7" or Mac OS 7.0.1</h3>

      <blockquote>
          System 7 was introduced by Apple Computer on May 13, 1995. Preceeding System 6, the original OS system, Mac OS 7 was a major player in creating pritine user interfaces. Transitioning between System 6 and 7, a few additional features were added:
          such as built-in co-operative multitasking, personal file sharing, drag and drop, and an improved user interface.
      </blockquote>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
         <p>
            According to the Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines, published in 1995, a checkbox is defined as:
            "A standard Macintosh control that displays a setting, either checked (on) or unchecked (off).
            Clicking a checkbox or its text label reverses its setting. One or more checkboxes can be checked."
            <strong>As seen in the figure below, checkboxes are typically seen as squares and radio boxes are typically seen circular.</strong>

        <h3>Labels</h3>
             <ul>
             <li>Every checkbox needs a label that clearly designates two opposing states.</li>
               <ul>
               <li>If a label does not imply opposing states, use radio boxes.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Labels for checkboxes allow users to understand the signficance of options.</li>
                </ul>
               </ul>
             <li>Labels must use book title capitalization style, i.e capitalize every word except articles, coordinating words and prepositions. </li>
             <li>Labels must be as specific as possible, but also concise and clear.</li>
             <ul>

             </ul>

              <li>This is similar to the screenshot to the right which indicates once "Read-Only" is checked the document can only be read not editted.</li>
              <li>Immediate action is necessary to make it clear to the user which input goes into effect. </li>

          <p>
            Within Menus, checkmarks are used to indicate which item is selected for a particular section. Menus contain two types of groups: exclusive versus nonexclusive attribute groups.
            In a mutually exclusive attribute group one item is affected at a time. However, in an accumulating (nonexclusive) attribute group, multiple attributes can be in effect at the same time.
            An example of this nonexclusive group in action is seen in dialog boxes, represented by checkboxes, as seen to the right. This checkbox contains the label: Read-Only. As mentioned earlier by the guidelines, this allows the user to clearly see an opposite state.
            In this case, when the option is off, the user can read and write (or make changes to) a file.

            <p>
              Help balloons give the user a look at the current state of the system by the way they phrase the sentences. For example, in the picture to the right the help ballon states: "To turn on text soothing, click this box." Currently, text soothing is not being used, but if the help balloon said: “To turn off text smoothing, click this box,” it would indicate text soothing is being used.
              Utilizing this simple, but effective help balloon allows users to make a mental note of how their action of "clicking the box" affects their next steps. As mentioned earlier, this is correctly labeling your checkbox for users to "understand the significance of options."
            <p>
              Help balloons are also needed when explaining unavailable checkboxes. This means describing what the box does when it’s selected and then why it is unavailable, similar to the unavailibility of a radio button.
              The figure bellow indicates an unavailable explaination; however, it is not a checkbox, it is just an example.

The radio button appears in setting options such as wifi, ringtone selection, and many more. Of all variants, the switch is the most popular in iOS. Applications like Clock and Settings make frequent use of the component.

        <p>
        Below are two examples of checkboxes in Mail. Notice in the first example, when no emails are selected the Move and Trash buttons help indicate the status of the checkboxes. Notice in the second example, the Mail application uses the color alteration and the original symbol to show selection. Here the component is used to indicate selection of individual emails so that an action can be applied to multiple at a time.

        <p>
        The following example emphasizes the different aesthetic design styles of iOS. The checkboxes in the Reminders application stand out from other platforms with their lack of a check symbol and color specification. Although there is differentiation, because the unchecked state is indicated by the empty circle the application does attempt to stay consistent with other applications.

              Next are the examples of radio buttons, indicated by small blue check marks. Depending on which choice is selected, the blue check mark will disappear off the previous option and appear on the most recent selection.

              Finally are the examples of switches. Most clearly exemplified in the Clock application. The switches act as a clear indication of whether an alarm with be set, or off. Since left and right positions of the switch do not have a global state meaning, the grey and green colors provide the greatest distinguishing factor between on and off states.

      <h3> Checkbox Selection and Use </h3>
      <p>
        The Apple Watch incorporates checkboxes for very specific actions. As shown in the image below, a user can go through a list of reminders he or she has, select certain tasks from the list, and use additional buttons to perform actions on the “checked” tasks (such as “Show Completed”). Something interesting to note about the image is that the checkboxes are actually empty circles when unchecked and circles with a dot inside when checked, as opposed to the traditional box style. This style choice is especially interesting for checkboxes since Apple generally reserves this look for their <em>radio buttons</em>. In fact this might have caused confusion among users which would explain why this style is sometimes <strong>different within the same application</strong> based on what software version the Apple Watch is on.

            As previously mentioned, the check box style of watchOS, Apple’s operating system for their Apple Watch, varies based on the software version. The Apple Watch screenshot to the right provides an example of this as it shows a list of reminders where rounded-squares represent checkboxes, whereas the image above represents checkboxes as circles. Interesting enough Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines for watchOS doesn’t specify which checkbox style it prefers. In fact, it <strong>doesn’t even have a section</strong> dedicated to checkboxes. However, the watchOS Guidelines does have a brief section on <em>switches</em>, a common variant of checkboxes in Apple operating systems.

            According to Apple’s Guidelines for switches on watchOS, “A switch is a visual toggle between two mutually exclusive states—on and off. A label indicating which property the switch affects must always be displayed next to a switch.” Apple does a good job of sticking to their guidelines as the two images to the right show switches being used in the Settings and Clock applications of the Apple Watch. In both images, a switch is placed next to the labels “Reduce Motion” and “Alarm” in oder to provide the user with an idea of what the switch’s effects will be from being on or off. Additionally, below the “Reduce Motion” label there is a small description to help explain what the switch does even more. Also, the image directly to the right magnifies over a switch in the off state.

            The image directly to the right illustrates two very important habits switches have when being turned off and on. First, the screenshot shows what switches look like when off and on. When the switch is off it and surrounding labels that are affected turn gray. When the switch is on it turns to a bright green color and surrounding labels that are affected turn white. Secondly, the image shows the area that the user must press to turn the switch on or off as represented by the two yellow rectangles. This was a nice design of Apple to make the surrounding area and label of the switch also ”tappable” since the actual switch would be pretty small even on the larger model of the Apple Watch. <strong>Note: this behavior is consistent with other interface elements including checkboxes!</strong>
