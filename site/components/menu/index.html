<p class="lead">One of the earliest and most common ways of representing equivalent information, the menu displays options for the user to select in order to find information or execute a function.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  <h4><strong>Typical Appearance</strong></h4>
</div>
  <p>A menu is a displayed set of options or commands for the user to select.
    These options/commands are often stacked vertically in the form of a list that
    can be read from top to bottom, ideally in an order that is convenient for the user.
    Common occurrences of these vertical menus are shown in the below slide show.</p>

          <h4 class="panel-title text-center alert-success">Typical Behavior</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Menus behave by reacting when a user selects an option, typically in the form of a 'click'.
             The "touch and hold" feature are now similar to an actual "click", as well as just
             simply touching the operation needed.</p>
          <p>The menu responds to a 'click' by carrying out the function that the user has selected. It is common behavior for menus to display contain one or more sub-menus, allowing for organization and efficiency. Accordian menus, for example, can expand/collapse to displace more/fewer options. This makes it easier for the user to navigate through a multitude of options without being overwhelmed with too much information at one time. </p>
          <p> Another example of some behaviors is having selection menus within other menus,
            a huge example of this is seen not only from Android but also across iOS platforms.
            When a selection in a menu is "clicked" it is often followed by another "sub menu"
            or called a "context menu" by android developers. </p>
            <p> Typically menus are layout in an order from frequently used operations first in the application
              currently opened, followed by commands in order of decreasing use,
              with the least used command at the bottom. </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-heading">
          <h4 class="panel-title text-center alert-success">Events</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>The most relevant menu event is the <code>click</code>. A <code>click</code> event indicates that the user has selected a particular action or item from the list. Another event is the <code>hover</code>, indicating that a pointing device is explicitly within the button’s bounds. Another event is the <code>scroll</code>, allowing the user to maneuver through the available options. Some platforms or implementations have included other components into an item, like a <code>swipe</code>, which can display alternative actions for the item, or a checkbox.</p>

          <p>In this instance, a click tells it whether to advance deeper or retreat out of the app. Scroll moves the selector around to allow the user to “click” what they want to.</p>
          <p> While the <code>click</code> event is used in both apple platforms and android, one unique feature
          that is apart of android is the <code>click and hold</code> event. Which allows the user
          to hold down the button triggered and move onto a seperate menu area. More of this can be seen
          in the Android Generic platform tab.</p>

          <p> As shown in the state diagram, that when an operation is "clicked"
            it is then triggered to enable or disable an event, but with enable the operation,
            it has the cause of then being able to trigger a scroll or hover event.</p>

        <p> These are only a few of the many interfaces that can be used to display options or actions. Depending on the content displayed, it may be better to create a custom interface. In the case of the OS X color picker, instead of listing names of colors in a standard menu, they opted to recreate a crayon box and visually display what the available colors are. In the case of the Apple TV, while you could simply list all possible apps, they opted for a grid to take better advantage of the wide aspect ratio of a TV.</p>
        <p>An easy way to locate menus in Google’s system is to search for three parallel bars, which clearly indicate more options.</p>

        <h4 class="panel-title text-center alert-success">Priority Metrics</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body text-center">
        <p>The basic menu being a fundamental component since the creation of the command-line interface, it has had plenty of time to mature and is on virtually every platform. As such, all usability metrics are important to it. The origins of menus date back to the days of pen and paper, as an easy way to organize equivalent information.</p>
        <p>Users who are seeing a menu for the first time are immediately familir with its use by its similarity to the pen and paper. This makes learnability easy as the concept is present from childhood. Between platforms and across time, the fundamentals of a basic menu haven't changed which maximizes memorability.</p>
        <p>Users must have no delays with using menus because it is the intermediate step between choosing an action or item and that action being performed or moving on with the item selection. Efficiency is of the essenence here. The primary time consumer is the scrolling of a manu that cannot fit onto the screen in its entirety. Depending on the platform, the scrolling event must be responsive.</p>
        <p>Users should never select an item in the menu by mistake. This is more in the realm of the interface component that is used within the item in the menu than the menu itself. However, for example, scrolling the menu should not be mistaken for selecting a particular item. This is up to the platform to make sure that the compents that can be used within items don't conflict with the menu itself.</p>
        <p><br><strong>Learnability:</strong> The learning curve for Android Auto is significantly worse than for Apple Carplay.
        <br><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Android Auto is more complicated than Apple’s simple, gridded layout, but can only accomplish the same amount of work.
        <br><strong>Memorability:</strong> Although it took a while to learn the system, once learned, is intuitive and usable.
        <br><strong>Errors:</strong> Not many errors other than how to activate the “Hey Google” button. That took a few minutes of playing around with the system and trial and error.
        <br><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> Doesn’t look at nice as Apple Carplay due to a non-adjusting aspect ratio (tested on two phones).</p>

      </div>
      <div class="panel-body text-center">
        <h6>Feedback</h6>
        <p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a menu must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
          never doubt whether:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>the scroll event was performed and the listings changes displayed</li>
          <li>the item they have currently selected (for platforms needing abstract pointing)</li>
          <li>the action being performed on a particular item (dependant on the platform and the available actions for an item)</li>
          <li> More Guidelines specific characteristics are in each platform's tab</li>

          <p>From the images of the directory menus, it can be observed that OS X breaks some of Windows' rules, such as using icons
          to represent menu titles (i.e. the settings gear icon).</p>

          <p>In addition to there being hidden menus, there are even hidden menu items (described as "Dynamic Menu Items" in OS X guidelines) that can be seen if the user holds down the "alt option" key for Mac. For example, the file menu at the top of the Desktop interface (with no applications open) has some hidden items that are revealed when the "alt option" key is pressed while the menu is open.</p>

          <p>With iOS, Apple was able to create the first direct interaction between a person and the content they are manipulating. Instead of having some device like a mouse or click wheel be the abstraction between the human interaction and the menu, the interface revolves around the direct interaction between the person and the content by way of finger touching. The event of scrolling is done by way of pushing the content on the screen up and down the screen. </p>
          <h4>iOS Guidelines</h4>
          <p>According to the iOS Guidelines, the most basic menu is the Table View. It displays data by dividing data into rows. The most basic type is plain, which options for a header, a footer, and an index that can be presented along the side of the list to more easily navigate the list. The second general type is grouped, whereby each group can have a header and/or footer. An index is not typical for this type.</p>

          <p>With Pebble, in the name of preserving battery life and minimizing user error, they decided to go with interaction by way of physical buttons along the side of the device, a touchscreen of that size argued as being a bit too clunky to hit the item you intend with your fingers.</p>
          <h4>Pebble Guidelines</h4>
          <p>According the Pebble design guidelines, some of the most important parts of the interface should be the speed of the interaction. Something else they emphasize is the the creation of a unique UI that isn't necessarily dependent on the Pebble UI. Simplicity is king.</p>

                especially when compared to IOS, is user customizability. You'll find a myriad of different types of menus when using
                the operating system. You'll find a lot more types of menus used with android, including, popup menus,
                checkable menus, and also contextual menus.</p>

            <h5> <strong>Android Guidelines</strong> </h5>
            <p> Based on Android menu Guidelines, there is a sense that user
            interaction plays a huge role into what type of menus that are created.
            When creating a menu there is a certain mind map that goes into play when creating features
            with menu screens. One main feature the is special to android is the
            <code>click and hold</code> event. In which the user touch and holds
                the button triggered and it opens up a "context menu" which is
                a sub menu of other related options to the operation triggered.</p>
                <p> This is primiarly used for <em>overflow</em>, in order to make the application
                  taskbar less cluttered. And for certain applications once an operation is selected
                  it gets added to the taskbar, other wise it stays clean for user-friendly interaction.</p>

            <p> As noted the position of icons, the layout, the order in which the operations are
              organized all effect the experience of the user. Selecting the right kind of menu to present,
              and using menus consistently, are critical factors in good application design for Android menus.

            <p>To summarize, Android has a lot of available options to assist
               in getting a user interface how the developer wants it to feel.
               And also helps the user easily navigate through menus without it being overwhelming to learn.
