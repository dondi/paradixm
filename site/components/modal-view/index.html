<p class="lead">A modal view is a child window to a main window. Modal views are used to draw a user's attention to an issue or suggestion and will disable interaction between the user and main window until the modal view is dismissed.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>Modal views typically prompt the user to perform an action before allowing the user to continue interacting with said window or application.</p>

                  <p>Modal views will usually be prompted when a window or application requires the user’s attention before continuing, such as when a user is able to update their system or if the window chooses to warn the user about committing an action. Modal views are also used by websites to inform the user about logins, advertisements, updates to the site, etc.</p>

                    <div class="panel-body">Modal view pop ups are incredibly intuitive to new users if used correctly.  Modal view pop ups are most typically used as a reaction to something the user is currently doing, has just done, or probably wants to do.  If used correctly and labeled properly, new users should not be confused by the purpose of a modal view pop up because of this.  The second place where learnability issues could arise is during the user interaction with the pop up.  Again, if used properly, a modal view pop up should contain only a few basic buttons or, if necessary, a very short form.  If the user will not be able to continue what they are doing until the pop up has been addressed, it should be required for the pop up to be addressed before it can be collapsed.  If the pop up is providing an essential piece of information or a form, and the user can continue doing what they are doing without addressing the pop up, it should be very easy to collapse the form.  These two guidelines are aimed to ensure new users are not led into a confusing application state.</div>

The most commonly used button should be highlighted so a user can simply hit the ‘Enter’ key to trigger it or so it can easily be identified.  The pop up should also consistently appear at the same time during the use of an application, so frequent users become accustomed to the timing of when the pop up will appear.  The pop up should also consistently appear in the same location, so it can easily be identified by frequent users.</div>

This view must typically be interacted with by the user, because the view will directly cause a change to the user’s system. The modal view typically asks the users to either cancel the download or continue before allowing the user to continue.</div>

                    <div class="panel-body">If a process is unable to be completed or ran into issues during execution, it is important to convey that information to the user, and thus a modal view is a good way to ensure the user receives that information.  For example, if a user attempts to print a document and the printer is unavailable, a modal view can notify the user that there was an issue printing the document.  A modal view conveying an error or a warning will not typically have a form for the user to fill out, but will simply use text to notify the user of the warning, perhaps using a few buttons to give the option to send an error report if the application they were using was being run through the network.</div>

Since the process cannot be completed until the user has been verified, using a modal view is appropriate.  Typically in this case, only the user’s name and password is required in a very simple form.  If the user is frequently verifying processes, some user information can be saved and filled out on the form to increase the efficiency of frequent users.</div>

                        <h2>iOS</h2>

                        <p>The modal view on the Iphone is a small white box that appears in the center of the screen.  Any clickable items are in blue text to highlight that they are interactable.  There is very little text to keep the modal view compact and there are very few clickable items to make the modal view easy to interpret and interact with.  The background behind the modal view is grayed out to signify that the modal view must be interacted with.  Modal views on the Iphone can also be interacted with using the thumbprint technology.</p>

                        <p>The typical modal view that appears on Mac OS X is a light gray text box providing the user with an option, such as to update or to sign in. A modal view appears on the screen to receive information from the user. The view will provide a blue button, labeled with the action the modal will perform if pressed by the user. The modal view will also typically provide a light gray cancel button for the user to press if the user doesn’t wish the modal view to perform the action the modal can execute.</p>
