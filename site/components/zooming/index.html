    <h3>Platform Specific Instances</h3>
    <p>When viewing content on a desktop, users can zoom in or out by way of the window menu or through predefined keyboard bindings. For example, Windows users may zoom in or out using the <code>CTRL+</code> or <code>CTRL-</code> commands respectively.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, users with a trackpad or viewing the content on a mobile smartphone are able to zoom out through the predefined gesture of pinching and zoom in by performing the gesture in reverse.</p>
