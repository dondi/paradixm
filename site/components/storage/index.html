<p class="lead"><b>Persistent storage is storage that keeps users' files safe. It
  is also sometimes referred to as non-volatile memory, because unlike volatile
  memory, or RAM, the storage persists even when the machine is rebooted. The user
  interface of storage management must be intuitive and efficient so the user can
  find and manage their files.

    <h3>Typical Appearance
    </h3>

    <p>Persistent storage appears in a variety of forms on devices, and each is
      targetted towards different needs of users.
    </p>
    <p>
      The images below are captured in Mac OSX but are typical of many different
      platforms with minor differences. For more information about platform-specific
      differences, see "Platform-Specific Instances" below.

    </div>
    <p>
      The most common way to navigate through persistent storage is through a
      file management app, like Finder or File Explorer. It typically has a side
      bar through which the user can click on folders and navigate to their
      desired file.
    </p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Another way to navigate through persistent storage is through the terminal
      window. This is relatively the same across many devices although the commands
      used to navigate to specific files may differ.
    </p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Another way to manage persistent storage is through a removable drive, such
      as a USB drive. The user would still manage this through the same finder window
      or terminal but the different location is worth mentioning.
    </p>


    <h3>Typical Behavior
    </h3>

    <p>Typical behavior of persistent storage includes the ability to access it in
      various ways, and its existence on all platforms. When the user saves a file,
      persistant storage is used. Another example of persistent storage is when a
      user inserts a usb into their computer and copies or moves files onto their
      device. The persistant storage is a place for files to be kept until
      accessed again.
    </p>


    <h4>Events
    </h4>

    <p> There are a few events that happen to persistent storage in it's various forms.
    </p>
    <p>A few basic events are opening a file, creating a file, deleting a file, and moving
      a file. Many of these events require an
      intermediary step that requires the user to do something that technically isn't part
      of the persistent storage. An example is when the user deletes a file they have to
      right click the file first and then press the recycle button or something of
      the sort.
    </p>
    <p>Finding a file is pretty basic the user can usually use a search bar or they can go
      to the location. They can do this multiple ways such as just looking through
      finder, in Mac, till they find the the file or doing it through the terminal.
    </p>
    <p> Creating a file is also pretty simple it usually just requires saving a file
      or downloading a file. Ex. Open a Microsoft file and write the words "Hello
      World" and then click Save As and save the file where they would like to save it.
    </p>
    <p>Deleting a file is again another easy event where a person usually right
      clicks the file and then presses "move to trash" or "Delete File" or one can
      also drag and drop the file into the thrash and it usually is move there.
    </p>
    <p>Copying and pasting a file is another way persistent storage works. One has
      to first copy the file then navigate through the persistent storage and then
      paste it where they want into the persistent storage.
    </p>

    <h4>State Diagram
    </h4>

    <p>A state diagram indicating the actions and states of a user interface component.

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>


    <p>The state diagram is quite simple but can be modified greatly. This is the most
      basic state diagram availabe for persistent storage. Persistent storage states and
      events vary so greatly that the descriptions are somewhat vague because it can entail
      a vast amount of options. The first step is when the user decided they want to modify
      an item in persistent storage. Then some intermediate step take place such as copy and
      paste, or delete, etc. The final step is actually modifying the persistent storage.

    <h3>Variants
    </h3>


    <ul>
      <li><b><em>Databases</em></b> are a type of persistent storage. One can navigate
        through a database through various ways an example of one would be Giphy and
        using the search bar to go through the information and find the information
        one was looking for
        <div class="col-md-12 col-md-12">
          <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-body">
              <img class="center-block" SRC = "Images/Untitled.gif" ALT = "Giphy gif" style="width:400px;height:228px;">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Another variant of persistent storage is <b><em>iCloud</em></b> and how it stores
        data on servers.
        If you own a iphone you most likely know what iCloud is, it backs up
        information on iphones. This is a type of persistent storage because it
        stores the data in a place where it can be accessed. The user interface
        aspect of this is the online place where this data gets accessed from.
        <div class="col-md-12 col-md-12">
          <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-body">
              <img class="center-block" SRC = "Images/iclouddrive.gif" ALT = "icloud gif" style="width:400px;height:228px;">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>A <b><em>USB</em></b> is another source of persistent storage, but is unique in the sense
        that it's removable and the user is able plug it in to get the information when
        necessary or get rid of information that they doesn't need or want by putting the files into the usb and then unplugging the usb.
        <div class="col-md-12 col-md-12">
          <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-body">
              <img class="center-block" SRC = "Images/flash.gif" ALT = "icloud gif" style="width:400px;height:228px;">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Priority Metrics
    </h3>

    <p>Persistent storage does have a learnability curve. One must first
      learn where all the folder and files are located and when doing something
      such as saving or downloading where the file or folder is placed. Also
      if the user were to access persistent storage through the terminal using the commands such as
      'cd' and 'ls' to find and acquire the file wanted, that would does require a major learning curve.
       This relates to the memorability metric because the more the user is
      able to remember where the files are the easier it makes it to find and
      retrieve. Organization is key here in finding and accessing files quickly.
    </p>


    <p>A big usability metric for persistent storage is errors. The user should be
      able to navigate through the persistent storage without getting lost
      and be able to find files easily and quickly. If someone clicks "Downloads"
      and it takes them to a page that doesn't have the files that were downloaded
      that would be problematic. A person shouldn't have trouble with errors of
      finding data in persistent storage if the user interface component is well
      thoughout and simple.
    </p>


    <p> Satisfaction does not play a large part in persistent storage because
      persistent storage doesn't really bring satisfaction. It just helps one keep
      their data stored in a safe place and be able to access it when needed. I mean
      I guess without persistent storage it would be a pain so everyone is secretly
      satisfied by persistent storage without knowing it.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Characteristics
    </h3>


    <p>What makes persistant storage effective?
    </p>


    <h4>Organization and guidelines
    </h4>

    <p>
      For the finder make sure your app bundle has the correct filename
      extension. The Finder looks for the .app filename extension and
      treats your app appropriately when it finds it. The Finder also shows
      or hides the filename extension, depending on the state of the "Show
      all filename extensions" preference in the Advanced pane of Finder preferences.
    </p>

    <p>Use an information property list to supply information to the Finder.
      The information property list (that is, an Info.plist file) is the
      standard place to store information about your app and document types.
      For information on what to put in this file, see Runtime Configuration Guidelines.
    </p>

    <p>Add the appropriate filename extension to documents users can create in
      your app. Accurate filename extensions help ensure platform interoperability.
      The user can also set a file type and optionally a creator type for a file, although
      this is not strictly necessary.
    </p>

    <p>Avoid changing the creator type of existing documents. The creator type
      implies a distinct sense of ownership over a file. Your app can assign a creator
      type for files it creates, but it should not change creator types for documents
      that are created by other apps unless the user gives explicit consent. Note that
      the user can still associate files with a specific app by using the Info window.
    </p>
    <p>Include a Quick Look generator if your app creates documents in an uncommon or custom format
    </p>

              <hr>
              <p>Mac OSX has many different ways to access the persistent storage.
                The most commonly used way is through the finder. The finder holds all the
                files and can be navigated through quite easily. Mac OS X has a friendly user
                interface because it has everything labeled. Also if the user does't know where the
                file resides they can always go to "All My Files" and just search the file
                name. It also has a tag system to keep one's files organized as shown by
                the gif(middle). The gif below shows how the finder looks and a few aspects
                of the finder (left) and how the user can open and delete files from persistent storage(right).

                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>Another way is through the terminal which is just like the finder, but
                  the finder is just a graphical representation. The terminal can be more
                  efficient than finder because the user can do so much more to a file with just
                  the terminal. The user can open the file, delete a file, add a file, and much
                  more with certain commands. There are intermediary step for persistent
                  storage. But it will keep your changes in the persistent storage. The terminal
                  is quicker and more efficient than the finder once the user has the memory and
                  commands down. It can also be sometimes of a nuisance, but is more efficient
                  in the end. The gif below shows a few things that can be done with the terminal
                  and how it can be friendly in terms of user interface, but is plain and requires
                  learning, while finder is much easier to learn, but slower. The terminal can
                  be used to access persistent storage online too such as using Git.

                  In Windows 10, the ability to save files, create folders, and delete folders
                  is represented fairly typically. The UI is intuitive, when selecting a file
                  to add to persistent storage, such as an image from a website(left), the user
                  can right click on the image and choose <code>save as</code> and then decide
                  where they want to store and what they want to name the file. Making a folder(middle)
                  and deleting files(right) are just as intuitive and typical in the interface.

                    Other aspects of persistent storage on Windows 10 include the Command
                    Prompt(left), which is similar to the OSX terminal, with the small difference of
                    the different commands that the user types in to access the same storage.

                  <p>The File Explorer window in Windows 10 has a couple unique features that
                    are worth mentioning. The first is the ability to resize the icons to be
                    able to preview files such as images at larger sizes without having to open
                    the file. The menu to change the icon size is compact with many visual images
                    which add to usability. Additionally Windows 10 allows the user to pin folders to
                    'Quick Access' which allows the user to go to a specific are for shortcuts
                    to their most used folders.
