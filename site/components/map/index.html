    <h1 class="display-3">What is a map component?</h1>
    <p class="lead">The demand of mobile technology has enabled maps to become an essential interface component in a wide range of applications. It is necessary that the map component is easy to navigate, because everyone uses maps via technology to navigate their every move throughout the city. </p>

    <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

    <blockquote>Across platforms, maps demonstrate a number of common characteristics in their appearance. Maps are presented with custom annotations, highlighted regions, and overlays. Users have full control to pan, rotate, zoom, and can explore maps in 3D and 2D. One can change the map settings from map, transit, and satellite. The maps also give users a sense of direction, where users can view their current location or can guide them to their next destination using directions APIs.</blockquote>

  <h3>Variants :</h3>

  <p><em>Embedded Maps</em> appear very similar to a full-featured map implementation, but typically restrict the availability of user interactions. For example, embedded maps on Thrillist.com do not permit the user to search for locations other than bars and restaurants. Users can only drop pins or can get directions to the location. These behaviors vary from site to site. It is clear that Thrillist is best known to find the hottest bars and restaurants near your location.</p>

  <p><em>Waze</em> is the largest community based traffic and navigation app. The app has implemented a map to show the user the location and the direction to take when driving. The app gathers data from drivers who are navigating through a certain route and assist with finding the most efficient way to reach your destination. Waze's maps are also created in real time, which means that if you are the first person to drive down a single road, you will create that road on Waze's map. The map reports: traffic, accidents, speed limits, road conditions, policemen on the highways, gas stations, and suggests songs from spotify. The interface was also created for a quick glance at a map, which means that the interface is easy to read and is not cluttered. It is clear that the most effiect map to use while driving is waze, because the fastest route is constantly updating to the most effiecient route.</p>

  <p><em>Uber</em> utilizes the integrated maps for the drivers and the users. The users use the integrated maps to set a pick up/drop off location by typing in an adress, by moving a pin to a location. Uber has improved the maps for drivers by updating the route in real time, requiring less app switching and less distractions for the driver. The maps show real time traffic, lane guidance, and night mode. Users who are resquestion a ride use the map to request a ride and can view the map to predict and can view the current driver location.</p>

    <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

    <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">

      <h4 class="alert-heading">Learnability</h4>

      <p>The learnability measure is quite an easy task for most maps that are integrated within our technology. Map implementation is up to date and is quite easy to learn. Developers have created maps to be user friendly by implementing several buttons that a first time user can quickly decide to click to perform a certain task. Once a user learns where all of the key components of the map are, the user will automatically know where to go. Maps are apart of everyones lives, therefore learnabaility needs to be simple for map components.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

      <h4 class="alert-heading">Efficiency</h4>

      <p>Efficiency must be highly prioritized by any implementation of a map component. Especially in mobile maps, users will require practically instant access to directions. If an experienced user has difficulty accessing geographic information they will likely become frustrated and possibly migrate to a different map application. In addition, if maps were inefficient the technological maps could cause trouble on the highways, by having a user spend to much time trying to understand a map. Therefore, it is critical for a map implementation to be effiecint with finding quick tasks, directions, and fast routes. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">

      <h4 class="alert-heading">Memorability</h4>

      <p>Most technology users access geographic information on a regular basis. The importance of memorability is again reduced by the relative simplicity of most map interfaces. Maps should not require too much memorization of operations for the typical user. The memorability metric may be considered more important in complex map implementations such as arcGis, but people tend to use such applications in a professional capacity; meaning that their use will likely be more regular and thus memorability is a less important measure of usability.</p>

    </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <h4 class="alert-heading">Errors</h4>
  <p>A low error rate characterizes a properly usable implementation of a map interface. This can be attributed to the prevalance of map components on mobile technologies. Mobile users of maps may be in motion when making use of a map interface, meaning that the safety of the user and of those around them could be compromised with each additional unexpected result.</p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  <h4 class="alert-heading">Satisfaction</h4>
  <p>User satisfaction is always an important measure of usability, and maps are no different. Developers must prioritize satisfaction in order to differentiate their implementation from those of their competitors. Everyone has their own preferance on certain map components. The top highest features for maps satisfaction include: the fastest route, uncluttered maps, real time map updates, traffic, and quick and easy to find features.</p>
</div>

<hr />
<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>Maps are one of the most useful components to navigate your way around. In order to make users understand the effects of their actions, any and all feedback must convey all relevant information in a manner that is visible and simple. For example, users must never doubt that they positively triggered the directions feature by typing in their depart location and their destination location. If users cancel the triggering direction feature, due to not wanting the direction route open; the action then triggers and disables that deature at the moment. </p>

<h4>Visibility</h4>

<p>Some elements of visibility can be considered feedback. Users must be able to easily identify both the features of the map itself and the signifiers of actions available to the user at any given time. Maps communicate so much information at once. The ability of the user to discern what they can and cannot interact with, but with the time remaining is capable of interpreting the geographic information of the map.</p>

<h4>Intuitive Affordances</h4>

<p>Maps communicate fundamental and physical information. Thus interactions with a well formed map component should mimic interactions with a physical object. Intuitive affordances is important because maps need to align with the mental model of maps for the users. This type of behavior can be seen in almost all popular map implementations. For example, Google Maps allow users to pan around the map as though they were manipulating a physical object, rather than only being able to commit the task with arrow keys or a button.</p>

    <h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

    <p>The primary function of any embedded map is to demonstrate some location in space. Maps implement behaviors such as:</p>

    <table class="table table-striped">

      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>#</th>
          <th>Behavior</th>

        <tr>
          <th scope="row">1</th>
          <td>Movement</td>
          <td>The ability to zoom, pan, and rotate the map (sometimes in 3-D space).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">2</th>
          <td>Search</td>
          <td>the ability to search for particular locations in the map</td>

          <td>the ability to point to and mark locations of interest</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">4</th>
          <td>Directions</td>
          <td>maps typically implement a routing function that will display to the user a route between two points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">5</th>
          <td>Snap to Current Location</td>
          <td>maps allow the user to snap to their immediate surroundings</td>

<h4>Events</h4>

<blockquote>An <em>event</em> is something that can happen to a user interface component. They are both conceptual and
  highly concrete in that events very frequently translate directly into a user interface component’s API.</blockquote>

              <p>The grab event is initiated when the user clicks and holds their click at any non-special location on the map. The Grab is accompanied by a small piece of feedback in the form of a cursor change (at least on macOS).</p>

              <p><em>The Pan</em>: Maintained while <code>mouse button down</code></p>

              <p>While the user has grabbed the map, one may move their mouse in any direction to have the map pan in the direction of the movement. The movement of the map essentially happens in real time along with the movement of the mouse.</p>

              <p><em>The Release</em>: initiated by <code>mouse button release</code></p>

              <p>User controlled map panning is completed when the user releases their mouse button. Depending on the implementation, the map may continue to move in the direction of its momentum when the mouse was released.</p>

          Apple's proprietary map implementation makes use of macOS. Specific features allow users to manipulate maps in interesting ways. These features can be seen in the following events:
           <hr />
            <p class="font-weight-bold">Zoom In/Out</p> 
            <p>Initiated and maintained by <code>pull (two fingers outward)</code> and <code>pinch (two fingers inward)</code> respectively. The behavior of the zoom is essentially the same as in any other map, but the input provides the user with greater tactile feedback than other applications.</p>   <hr />
            <p class="font-weight-bold">Rotate</p> 
          <p>Initiated and maintained by: <code>two finger rotate</code>. Rotation operates the same as in other applications, but can be triggered in Apple Maps not only by clicking the corresponding button on the interface itself, but also by a more tactile operation.</p>   <hr />
           <p class="font-weight-bold">Drop Pin</p> 
          <p> Initiated by <code>force click</code>. The drop pin can be initiated in Apple maps via force click, a proprietary operation.</p>
