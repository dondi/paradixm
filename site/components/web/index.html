      <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The typical appearance of an embedded web view can be seen in client-side applications where an embedded page view
          is present. Embedded web page views tend to be in a window that can be manipulated and have various sizing options
          available to change width and height. Embedded web page views are seen in most mobile applications today and certain
          sections of websites as well. On a desktop website, an embedded web page view typically contains a bit of information
          pulled from the database of a website. On mobile applications, embedded web page views serve a greater purpose. Embedded
          web page views are commonly used to build the mobile application of a website. While the mobile application may not look
          exactly the same as the website, the theme and flow of application should following its parent site. Color schemes are
          generally similar and the overall purpose of the application should serve the same or a very similar function to the
          original site.</p>

      <h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Embedded web page views are used to present a website’s information in a different format that leads to
          greater accessibility for users.</p>
      </blockquote>

    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <h4>Events</h4>

      <p>Events can vary greatly, depending on the mobile application and its purpose. Generally speaking, the <code>click</code> function will
        be one of the most important events for embedded web page views that the user will notice. A click on a desktop is when the user
        hovers the cursor over a command and selects it through a physical device such as a mouse or track pad. A click on a mobile
        device is when the user physically touches the screen at a specific point where a command is.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p style="text-align:center">
            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="desktopClick.gif" alt="Desktop Click Example" style="width: 80%">

          user physically touching the screen.</p>
        </div>

      <p>When a user clicks on an element that serves a purpose, an event is triggered in the background. The literal fact of the
        event being triggered is invisible to the user, but the result is likely not.</p>

      <p>Another important event essential to embedded web page views are <code>API requests</code>. An API request is when a program requests to
        receive specific data located at a URL from a website. The common name of the command to request the data retrieval is <code>GET</code>.
        If the request has permission to access the data and is conducted successfully, the embedded web page will collect the data. There
        are numerous of different kinds of data that can be pulled from a website’s database. It is up to the developer of an embedded
        web page to determine how that information is applied.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">
        <img class="img-thumbnail" src="apiRequestExample.png" alt="State Diagram Web">
      </p>

      <p style="font-style:italic; text-align:center">Here is an example of an API request coming from this page itself. Later on in this documentation is an example of an embedded
        web view. If the user utilizes Chrome’s Inspect function and looks under the tab Network, it shows that there was an API request for
        www.espn.com. The request was successful and the page received multiple responses from ESPN’s website.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12">

      <h4>State Diagram</h4>

      <p>The state diagram for a basic embedded web view is fairly straightforward. When a website or mobile app is initially opened,
        the state diagram begins. This first page, generally a login or home page, will call the data from the respective website that
        is intended to be called. After receiving the API request and provided that the application has access to it, the website will
        fulfill the request and return data to the application. Once the page and data has been completely loaded, the site or application
        should hit a resting point. Data has been pulled into the embedded web page view and is presented at the discretion of the
        programmer. The only condition that will change the state of the site or application is an event being triggered. Some examples of
        this would be logging into an application or clicking on a link within the embedded web view. Since these events require more data
        to be pulled or analyzed, the API request from the website will have to be conducted again.</p>

      <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

      <blockquote><code>Efficiency</code> and <code>learnability</code> are the arguably the most important metrics.</blockquote>

      <p>Because embedded web views are such a common theme of virtually every user interface available today, it can be said that
        all usability metrics are equally important for this component. However, when web designers are trying to make sure their product stands out form the rest, they want something that is easy for their customers to use, and just as easy to learn.</p>

      <p>Users want the quickest means possible while using a website (efficiency), particularly because users want to look up or find some information online in the best manner possible. Users want to be able to use and perform the same actions in the same way across multiple sites/platforms (leanrability). Web views must be easy to use and understand, without too much complication.</p>

      <p>There is no distinct "low-priority" metric that can be asscociated with a web component. Because they vary in appearence, themes, and functions, a web view can be very diverse, with goals ranging from user satisfaction, as seen in sleek web apps like Alien Blue, a <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit.com</a> client for iOS.</p>

      <span style="text-align:center">

        <p>Or, there can be more simple, efficient places that will act as an easy to use mobile web interface for their bigger, online counterparts, like the Google Sheets app, as seen here:</p>

        <h4>Google Sheets</h4>
        <p style="text-align:center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_2URq5n5UFA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

      <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

      <p>Relating back to the some of the priority metrics, the key to a usable and efficient embedded web page is fluid
        <code>navigation</code>. The user using an embedded web page in a mobile application generally will have some kind of understanding
        of the desktop website for the same website. With this in mind, it is important for the navigation of the desktop
        website and the mobile application to have similar navigation flow and layout. Color themes being the same and
        buttons being in the same general location are examples of keeping the layout and flow consistent between the
        desktop website and mobile application</p>

         <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h4 style="text-align:center">Mobile Homepage</h4>
            <p style="text-align:center">
              <img class="img-thumbnail" src="evernoteMobileMenu.png" alt="Youtube Mobile Menu" style="width: 50%">
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h4 style="text-align:center">Desktop Website Homepage</h4>
            <p style="text-align:center">
              <img class="img-thumbnail" src="evernoteWebMenu.png" alt="Youtube Website Menu" style="width: 100%">
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The two images above are Evernote’s mobile home page and desktop home page respectively when the user has logged
          in. One consistency is the styling of Evernote on both the webpage and embedded web page view. The font and color
          scheme is the same on both platforms. Not only that, but the icons used remain consistent. The primary difference
          between the two is that the desktop website is able to show both the user’s notes and one specific note file
          simultaneous. The mobile web app lacks this feature due to having a smaller screen with an emphasis on the vertical
          height. Another distinction is the plus icon is on the bottom right of the mobile app while at the top left of the
          desktop website. This is likely due to the plus button being easier to select with the user’s thumb for users who
          are right handed. Overall the mobile application is essentially a compressed version of the desktop website.
          The functionality of the desktop website is still in the mobile application, but there are some more menu
          navigation required. It is clear that Evernote prioritized the navigation of their mobile application to be
          similar if not identical to the desktop website which leads to an efficient and easy to learn system.</p>

<h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-12">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <h4>WebView</h4>
      <p>Android provides a powerful class called <code>webview</code> for developers to utilize. There are several commands and
         tools that webview provides. Some of these commands are loadUrl, setJavaScriptEnabled, and so on. There is
         a large library provided for developers to use as they please. This results in virtually endless possibilities
         of how webview can be used to create embedded web page views. Not only that, but webview has proven to be scalable on an
         industrial level.</p>
      <p style="text-align:center">
         <img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/imgs/webview-debugging.png" alt="Testing Example" style="width: 50%">
      </p>
      <p>WebView offers plenty of options for editing and fine-tuning a developer’s mobile application with embedded web page views.
        The image above provides an example of a mobile application being tested. A developer is able to simultaneous test their mobile
        application and see their program at the same time. For embedded web page views, this is helpful for checking to see if API
        requests have passed or failed, quick changes to see how the developer’s program functions, and much more.</p>

      <h4>iOS content</h4>
      <p>On iOS devices, <code>web</code> objects tend to take the form of <code>Applications</code>, being fullscreen
         pages showing an "app" version of their contents. In contrast to desktops, iOS <code>web</code> will generally
         try to appeal to priority metrics for apps.
