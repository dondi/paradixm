<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

<blockquote>Generally, across any platform, a button will take the form of any shape whose form will elicit some understanding of the button's function, or will display a design that would hold the same purpose.</blockquote>

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally speaking, a button will perform no action while idle. Upon being pressed, a button will perform its action, then will return to its idle state.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Events</h4>

<p>The most obvious and commonly occuring button event is the <code>click</code>. A <code>click</code> event indicates that the button has been initialized and upon release will perform its action. This is closely related to the <code>release</code> event. Secondary events </p>

<p>The <code>enabled</code> and <code>disabled</code> states can be considered idle button states, as they are the only possible states the button can hold without user interaction. The <code>enabled</code> state indicates that a user <em>can</em> interact with it, while the <code>disabled</code> indicates that a user <em>cannot</em>.</p>

<p>When a button is <code>enabled</code>, additional states may be triggered. Of course, these states are subject to vairation depending upon the system in use, but a general list of the states are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hover</code>: For platfoms with peripherals such as mice or styluses, positioning the cursor over the button will elicit this state. Generally, it is indicated visually by a highlighting effect on the button. This is done to indicate that the button is prepared to be interacted with.</li>

  <li><code>armed</code>: Should the user interact with the button with a click, press, etc. the button may enter this state, indicating that the button is prepared to perform its action upon being released from this state. Most systems have a way to exit this state without actually activating the button Many button implementations allow an “out”
    from this state, in case the user changes his or her mind in mid-action.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Component in Action</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Embedded or linked video (by you or by others [and if by others give credit]) showing the component in action.</p>

  <p>For components that are available on a web platform, you can embed an actual component right here, such as:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class ="media-embed"><img src="Button1.gif" alt="Button gif 1" class="img-responsive"></div>

<p class="text-center">
  <button class="btn btn-default">Sample Button</button>
  <button class="btn btn-default disabled">Sample Disabled Button</button>
</p>

  </div>

  <div class="col-sm-6">
<h3>Variants</h3>

<blockquote>Buttons are some of the most versatile and widely used interface components. They are used for slightly different and more specialized uses that deviate from the average everyday application of the button. Some of the most significant variances are as follows:</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><em>Check Boxes</em> function in almost identically to buttons, with an additional set of states. These additional states indicate whether or not the check box has been checked or not. Things like <code>hover</code> and <code>armed</code> are shared. In terms of function, check boxes are useful for visualizing options.</li>

  <li><em>Links</em> function essentially as buttons, as they generally hold all the same states and rarely have any unique states. The distinction here is that a link is specifically made to navigate to a different display from the one the link exists on. There is even less fundamental difference between buttons and links than there were with check boxes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

<p>Because the button is such a widely utilized tool in virtually every user interface available today, it is fair to say that each one of the usability metrics is equally important for buttons. It is generally very easy for first time users to pick up the idea of a button, due to the fact that they closely emulate the functionality or real world physical buttons (learnability). The high priority of learnability also implies that memorability is a given.</p>

<p>It is vital that buttons not introduce significant delay to a process (efficiency), due to the fact that they are such result driven devices, and thus users expect their input to be visualized or effective immediately. Failing to do so, can lead users to hit buttons multiple times with the belief that their initial inputs were not registered (error).</p>

<p>The least significant metric in terms of buttons has to be satisfaction. This is because there is a severe limitation on the enjoyment that can be derived from hitting a button. This can easily be attributed to its purely utilitarian function and use.</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

<p>According to Google, buttons can hold different design characteristics based upon the significance they hold in comparison to the content surrounding the button. For example, adding a <em>raised</em> effect to the button or adding a shadow to it for a 3D effect can make it more pronounced. See the below images for examples.</p>

<div class ="media-embed"><img src="FlatButton.png" alt="Flat Button" class="img-responsive"></div>

<div class ="media-embed"><img src="RaisedButton.png" alt="Raised Button" class="img-responsive"></div>

<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>By far the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
  never doubt whether:</p>

<ol>
  <li>they did positively trigger a button and are thus the device is going to perform the appropriate action</li>
  <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, and subsequentially the button's resulting function will not take place</li>
</ol>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

  <h3>CyanogenMod 12.1 based on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop</h3>
  <p>On CyanogenMod 12.1, buttons are fully compliant with Google's material design. They are generally very simple and clean, using vibrant colors to stand out on the screen. They are almost always either simple shapes such as rectangles or circles, and use graphics on the buttons to make it clear what function will be performed after pressing the buttons.</p>

<div class ="media-embed"><img src="ScreenshotCalander.png" alt="Calander"></div>
<p>Here is an example of the simple, yet vibrant button design in the calander application.</p>

  <p>Unlike devices that utilice peripherals for input such as mice and styluses, most Android based devices operate fully based upon touch input. The difference this makes is that there can be no hover state for buttons. Conversely, touch input allows for a new state that the other systems do not, which is hold. In CM 12.1, when holding a button, if the button has a secondary function, this is how it is accessed. This will usually include such things as advanced options, or a popup containing a context-sensitive menu. For buttons that do not have such features, holding the button will cause it to highlight, and a circle will expand from the point of contact with the screen to cover the whole button. This provides a pleasant visualization that makes it clear that the touch has been registered, and also adds a nice boost to the satisfaction usability metric.</p>

<div class ="media-embed"><img src="ScreenshotHighlight1.png" alt="Highlight1" class="img-responsive"></div>

<p>Here you can see an example of the Android Version button being held down, and is therefore being highlighted and you can see the circle blooming across the surface of the button.</p>

<div class ="media-embed"><img src="ScreenshotHighlight2.png" alt="Highlight2" class="img-responsive"></div>

<p>Here you can see the gear button in the top of the image being selected, and is subsequentially being highlighted to visualize the fact that it is being activated.</p>

<div class ="media-embed"><img src="ScreenshotHome.png" alt="Home" class="img-responsive"></div>
<p>Here, the home button at the bottom in the middle has been held down, and an alternate button has popped up that will, in this case, bring you to the Google Now application, should the user choose to press on it.

<h3>Possibly the most important component of any user interface is the button, 
something which triggers an action.</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6">

<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

<blockquote>Buttons tend to look similar throughout many platforms. Usually they are rectangular 
and have a word or an image in them indicating what clicking on the button will actually do.</blockquote>

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buttons are sometimes highlighted according to the typical action that a user will take. 
For example,the buttons OK and CANCEL might be right next to each other on a page, but it is 
likely that OK will be highlighted while CANCEL will not be. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Events</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A button's event is simply the function of a particular button. </p>

<p>There are two common button events. The first is the "click". This event notifies the computer 
that the button has been triggered and the user wants the computer to perform whatever that button 
is there for. The second event is "hover." If the user interface is well-made, when the user hovers
over a button, the mouse pointer will change shape to let the user know that there is an option
for a "click" event to occur. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>State Diagram</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buttons typically have anywhere between two main states and possibly 2 substates, depending on the device being used. 
The states are as follows: <code>static</code>, <code>disabled</code>, <code>hover</code>, and <code>active</code>. </p>

  <p>In the <code>static</code> state, which is the idle or enabled state, the button is ready to be clicked. The <code>disabled</code>
state is that in which the user is not interacting with a button, or if the button has already been clicked it may not be clicked 
again. </p>


  <p>When a button is in it's <code>static</code> state, additional states may be triggered. They are: </p>
  <ul>
  <li><code>hover</code>: This is the state in which the mouse hovers over the button and either changes the button's color or the pointer's shape
to let the user know that the button is ready to be clicked.</li>

  <li><code>active</code>: This state occurs when a button has already been triggered, or clicked and is attempting to complete it's
action. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Variants</h3>

<blockquote>There are many variations of buttons, there isn't just one type. There are 3 main variations and they are as
follows: </blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><em>Buttons</em> indicate an action upon touch and are typically labeled using a text, icon or both.
 are very close to buttons in behavior—they perform individual action elements upon simple
    invocation by a user. However, they belong to a broader context/structure of a menu, and look sufficiently
    different that they are both conceptually and programmatically viewed as distinct from buttons.</li>

  <li><em>Dropdown Buttons</em> consist of a button that when clicked displays a drop-down list of mutually exclusive items.  
  They sometimes resemble a menu and are sometimes referred to as Menu Buttons. 
      <p>
         <img src= "dropdown.jpg" WIDTH=80 HEIGHT=80> </p>
     
  
  <li><em>Toggles</em> allow the user to change a setting between two different states. Toggle buttons are most effective 
  when the on/off states are visually distinct. 
     <div class="container">
        <label class="switch">
         <input type="checkbox" class="switch-input">
         <span class="switch-label" data-on="On" data-off="Off"></span>
         <span class="switch-handle"></span>
        </label>
  
  <li><em>Links</em> allow the user to navigate to a different page with just the one click. Links are very easily 
distinguishable from other buttons because they are usually underlined, blue, and when a mouse pointer hovers over them
the mouse becomes a hand icon. </li>

<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Learnability/Memorability: Buttons are basically a part of every single user interface used today. Because of this buttons should on the most part
be universal. As mentioned above, the typical appearance of a button is a simple shape with some text or an icon inside of it.
Since buttons are typically the same throughout all platforms, it should not be difficult for users to be able to figure
out how to use buttons. 
</p>

<p>Efficiency/Errors: Each button has one action to complete, thus once clicked the action should be performed fairly quickly. 
There should be no delay or too much time waste from the time where the user knows what they want to do and when they actually 
click the button. Relating to that, buttons should be well-labeled and in a position where users will not accidentally mistake
one button for another. For example, everyone knows the placement of the OK and CANCEL buttons, so if one platform were to decide
to switch those, a lot of users would do the wrong action. 
</p>

<p>Satisfaction: Users do not really find any satisfaction in clicking buttons so this metric is not completely applicable to 
buttons. On the other hand, sometimes buttons do crazy things, for example, Google's "I'm feeling lucky" button sometimes shows 
fireworks on the screen, but it won't do that every time. Besides that, satisfaction does not really apply. </p>

<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
  never doubt whether:</p>

<ol>
  <li>they did positively trigger a button (and thus its associated action)</li>
  <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, due to changing their minds midway through
    the action that triggers the button</li>
</ol>

<h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

<blockquote> 
<h3>Windows 10 </h3>

  <p>As mentioned above, even for Windows 10 buttons, buttons are typically rectangular but sometimes may either have mildly 
rounded corners or really sharp edges. The default button has a blue dotted line around it. Windows also tends to draw attention 
to more important buttons by either highlighting or making the button bigger. 
</p>

  <p>Typically the EXIT, MINIMIZE, and MAXIMIZE controls are all at the upper right hand corner of the window. </p>

  <p>Windows also color-codes a lot of their buttons. For example, RED will be used for <code>SHUT DOWN</code> because RED is a 
danger color and lets the user know that once they click that button there is no going back. YELLOW will be used for <code>LOG OFF</code>
warning the user that this is a semi-critical button. Then there are other buttons such as HELP that are a soft blue color 
because pressing them will not do anything to your program. 

<p> Windows has recently created a completely different way to display buttons, applications and commands on their screen. Clicking one
one of these buttons will navigate the user to a different page.</p>

<h3>Possibly the most important component of any user interface is the button, 
something which triggers an action.</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6">

<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

<blockquote>Buttons tend to look similar throughout many platforms. Usually they are rectangular 
and have a word or an image in them indicating what clicking on the button will actually do.</blockquote>

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buttons are sometimes highlighted according to the typical action that a user will take. 
For example,the buttons OK and CANCEL might be right next to each other on a page, but it is 
likely that OK will be highlighted while CANCEL will not be. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Events</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A button's event is simply the function of a particular button. </p>

<p>There are two common button events. The first is the "click". This event notifies the computer 
that the button has been triggered and the user wants the computer to perform whatever that button 
is there for. The second event is "hover." If the user interface is well-made, when the user hovers
over a button, the mouse pointer will change shape to let the user know that there is an option
for a "click" event to occur. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>State Diagram</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buttons typically have anywhere between two main states and possibly 2 substates, depending on the device being used. 
The states are as follows: <code>static</code>, <code>disabled</code>, <code>hover</code>, and <code>active</code>. </p>

  <p>In the <code>static</code> state, which is the idle or enabled state, the button is ready to be clicked. The <code>disabled</code>
state is that in which the user is not interacting with a button, or if the button has already been clicked it may not be clicked 
again. </p>


  <p>When a button is in it's <code>static</code> state, additional states may be triggered. They are: </p>
  <ul>
  <li><code>hover</code>: This is the state in which the mouse hovers over the button and either changes the button's color or the pointer's shape
to let the user know that the button is ready to be clicked.</li>

  <li><code>active</code>: This state occurs when a button has already been triggered, or clicked and is attempting to complete it's
action. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Component in Action</h4>

<blockquote>

  <p>For components that are available on a web platform, you can embed an actual component right here, such as:</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="text-center">
  <button class="btn btn-default">OK</button>
  <button class="btn btn-default disabled">Disabled</button>
  <button class="btn btn-success">Success</button>
  <button class="btn btn-danger">Delete</button>
</p>

  </div>

<div class = "row">
  <div class="col-xs-6">
<h3>Variants</h3>

<blockquote>There are many variations of buttons, there isn't just one type. There are 3 main variations and they are as
follows: </blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><em>Buttons</em> indicate an action upon touch and are typically labeled using a text, icon or both.
 are very close to buttons in behavior—they perform individual action elements upon simple
    invocation by a user. However, they belong to a broader context/structure of a menu, and look sufficiently
    different that they are both conceptually and programmatically viewed as distinct from buttons.</li>

  <li><em>Dropdown Buttons</em> consist of a button that when clicked displays a drop-down list of mutually exclusive items. 	
	They sometimes resemble a menu and are sometimes referred to as Menu Buttons. 
      <p>
         <img src= "dropdown.jpg" WIDTH=80 HEIGHT=80> </p>
     
  
  <li><em>Toggles</em> allow the user to change a setting between two different states. Toggle buttons are most effective 
  when the on/off states are visually distinct. 
     <div class="container">
        <label class="switch">
         <input type="checkbox" class="switch-input">
         <span class="switch-label" data-on="On" data-off="Off"></span>
         <span class="switch-handle"></span>
        </label>
  
  <li><em>Links</em> allow the user to navigate to a different page with just the one click. Links are very easily 
distinguishable from other buttons because they are usually underlined, blue, and when a mouse pointer hovers over them
the mouse becomes a hand icon. </li> 
<a href="www.yahoo.com">www.yahoo.com</a>

<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
  <p>Because the button is such a fundamental part of virtually every user interface available today, it can be said that
  all usability metrics are equally important for this component. Users who are seeing a button in a given platform for
  the first time must not have any issues recognizing it and knowing what to do with it (learnability). The high
  priority of learnability also implies that memorability is a given.</p>

  <p>Users must also never experience undue delays with using a button (efficiency), particularly because using a button
  almost always involves an instantaneous, immediate-result action. Users should almost never trigger a button by
  mistake (errors)—especially buttons whose actions result in significant changes to data or the real world.</p>

  <p>If any metric at all can be considered as a “low priority” for buttons, it would be satisfaction. The button is such
  a utilitarian component that “fun” or “enjoyment” is hardly associated with its use. One exception to this
  prioritization may be for buttons in applications whose primary metric is satisfaction (e.g., games, entertainment).
  As a part of that overall system, making buttons “fun” may then become more important than in other situations.</p>
