        <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

        <blockquote>Generally, across any platform, a button will take the form of a shape whose form will elicit some understanding of the button's function, or will display a design that would hold the same purpose. Buttons tend to look similar throughout many platforms. </blockquote>

        <h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p> Generally speaking, a button will perform no action while idle. Upon being pressed, a button will perform its action, then will return to its idle state. Buttons are sometimes highlighted according to the typical action that a user will take. For example, the buttons OK and CANCEL might be right next to each other on a page, but it is likely that OK will be highlighted, while CANCEL will not be. 
        </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Events</h4>

        <p>A button's event is simply the function of a particular button. There are two common button events. The first is the <code>click</code>. A <code>click</code> event indicates that the button has been initialized and upon release will perform its action. This is closely related to the <code>release</code> event. The second event is "hover." If the user interface is well-made, when the user hovers over a button, the mouse pointer will change shape to let the user know that there is an option for a "click" event to occur. </p>

          <p>The following diagram shows the 5 states of a standard button, and the different triggers that cause them to be entered/left.</p>

        <p>The <code>enabled</code> and <code>disabled</code> states can be considered idle button states, as they are the only possible states the button can hold without user interaction. The <code>enabled</code> state indicates that a user <em>can</em> interact with it, while the <code>disabled</code> indicates that a user <em>cannot</em>.</p>

        <p>When a button is <code>enabled</code>, additional states may be triggered. Of course, these states are subject to vairation depending upon the system in use, but a general list of the states are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>hover</code>: For platfoms with peripherals such as mice or styluses, positioning the cursor over the button will elicit this state. Generally, it is indicated visually by a highlighting effect on the button. This is done to indicate that the button is prepared to be interacted with.</li>

          <li><code>armed</code>: Should the user interact with the button with a click, press, etc. the button may enter this state, indicating that the button is prepared to perform its action upon being released from this state. Most systems have a way to exit this state without actually activating the button many button implementations allow an “out” from this state, in case the user changes his or her mind in mid-action.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Component in Action</h4>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Below is a embedded video of our component in action as well as some example buttons.</p>

          <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h3>Variants</h3>

        <blockquote> Buttons are some of the most versatile and widely used interface components. They indicate an action upon touch, and are typically labeled using a text icon or both. Some of the most significant variances in button function are as follows:</blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li><em>Check Boxes</em>  function almost identically to buttons, with an additional set of states. These additional states indicate whether or not the check box has been checked or not. Things like <code>hover</code> and <code>armed</code> are shared. In terms of function, check boxes are useful for visualizing options.</li>

          <li><em>Links</em> allow the user to navigate to a different page with just the one click. Links function essentially as buttons, as they generally hold all the same states and rarely have any unique states. The distinction here is that a link is specifically made to navigate to a different display from the one the link exists on. Links are very easily distinguishable from other buttons because they are usually underlined, blue, and when a mouse pointer hovers over them the mouse becomes a hand icon.</li>

          <li><em> Dropdown Buttons</em> display a drop-down list of mutually exclusive items. They sometimes resemble a menu and can be referred to as Menu Buttons. </li>

          <li><em>Toggles</em> allow the user to change a setting between two different states. Toggle buttons are most effective when the on/off states are visually distinct.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><em> Learnability/Memorability: </em> Buttons are an essential part of most modern digital user interface used today. Because of this buttons should universally similar in function and appearance. As mentioned above, the typical appearance of a button is a simple shape with some text or an icon inside of it. Since buttons are typically the same throughout all platforms, it should not be difficult for users to be able to figure out how to use nor identify them.</li>
          <li><em> Efficiency/Errors: </em>  Each button has one action to complete, thus once clicked the action should be performed fairly quickly. There should be no delay or too much time waste from the time where the user knows what they want to do and when they actually click the button. Relating to that, buttons should be well-labeled and in a position where users will not accidentally mistake one button for another. For example, everyone knows the placement of the OK and CANCEL buttons, so if one platform were to decide to switch those, a lot of users would do the wrong action.</li>
          <li><em> Satisfaction:</em> Users do not really find any satisfaction in clicking buttons so this metric is not completely applicable to buttons. On the other hand, sometimes buttons do crazy things, for example, Google's "I'm feeling lucky" button sometimes shows fireworks on the screen, but it won't do that every time. Besides that, satisfaction does not really apply unless a certain button has a special function.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

        <p>According to Google, buttons can hold different design characteristics based upon the significance they hold in comparison to the content surrounding the button. For example, adding a <em>raised</em> effect to the button or adding a shadow to it for a 3D effect can make it more pronounced. See the below images for examples.</p>
        <center>
          <img src="FlatButton.png" width="200" height="300"></img>
          <img src="RaisedButton.png" width="200" height= "300"></img>
        </center>
        <h4>Feedback</h4>

        <p>By far the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
          never doubt whether:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>they did positively trigger a button and are thus the device is going to perform the appropriate action</li>
          <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, and subsequentially the button's resulting function will not take place</li>
        </ol>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="Android">
        <h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

        <h3>CyanogenMod 12.1 based on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop</h3>
        <p>On CyanogenMod 12.1, buttons are fully compliant with Google's material design. They are generally very simple and clean, using vibrant colors to stand out on the screen. They are almost always either simple shapes such as rectangles or circles, and use graphics on the buttons to make it clear what function will be performed after pressing the buttons.</p>

        <div class ="media-embed"><img src="ScreenshotCalander.png" alt="Calander"></div>
        <p>Here is an example of the simple, yet vibrant button design in the calander application.</p>

        <p>Unlike devices that utilice peripherals for input such as mice and styluses, most Android based devices operate fully based upon touch input. The difference this makes is that there can be no hover state for buttons. Conversely, touch input allows for a new state that the other systems do not, which is hold. In CM 12.1, when holding a button, if the button has a secondary function, this is how it is accessed. This will usually include such things as advanced options, or a popup containing a context-sensitive menu. For buttons that do not have such features, holding the button will cause it to highlight, and a circle will expand from the point of contact with the screen to cover the whole button. This provides a pleasant visualization that makes it clear that the touch has been registered, and also adds a nice boost to the satisfaction usability metric.</p>

        <div class ="media-embed"><img src="ScreenshotHighlight1.png" alt="Highlight1" class="img-responsive"></div>

        <p>Here you can see an example of the Android Version button being held down, and is therefore being highlighted and you can see the circle blooming across the surface of the button.</p>

        <div class ="media-embed"><img src="ScreenshotHighlight2.png" alt="Highlight2" class="img-responsive"></div>

        <p>Here you can see the gear button in the top of the image being selected, and is subsequentially being highlighted to visualize the fact that it is being activated.</p>

        <div class ="media-embed"><img src="ScreenshotHome.png" alt="Home" class="img-responsive"></div>
        <p>Here, the home button at the bottom in the middle has been held down, and an alternate button has popped up that will, in this case, bring you to the Google Now application, should the user choose to press on it.

        <blockquote> 
        <h3>Windows 10 </h3>

          <p>As mentioned above, even for Windows 10 buttons, buttons are typically rectangular but sometimes may either have mildly 
        rounded corners or really sharp edges. The default button has a blue dotted line around it. Windows also tends to draw attention 
        to more important buttons by either highlighting or making the button bigger. 
        </p>

          <p>Typically the EXIT, MINIMIZE, and MAXIMIZE controls are all at the upper right hand corner of the window. </p>

          <p>Windows also color-codes a lot of their buttons. For example, RED will be used for <code>SHUT DOWN</code> because RED is a 
        danger color and lets the user know that once they click that button there is no going back. YELLOW will be used for <code>LOG OFF</code>
        warning the user that this is a semi-critical button. Then there are other buttons such as HELP that are a soft blue color 
        because pressing them will not do anything to your program. 

        <p> Windows has recently created a completely different way to display buttons, applications and commands on their screen. Clicking one
        one of these buttons will navigate the user to a different page.</p>

                         The functionality of buttons on the watchOS mirror the general button functions. They perform a function upon being pressed.
                          Buttons generally are usually armed when pressed, but do not activate until the user releases his/her finger off the button.
                        This allows for one to cancel the button activation by sliding the finger off the armed button instead of releasing. However, since the Apple watch’s primary input source is as touchscreen, buttons tend to sometimes have additional functions when held instead of clicked.
                        When clicked watchOS buttons fade to provide feedback to the user.

                        <li>The most effective buttons are the ones that are simple, and do their function seamlessly with the rest of the application. This is especially important with the watchOS because the apple watch has a small touchscreen. This makes it even more important than usual to have well designed buttons that have a quick response time. This is because most of the user inputs are quick touches, and need to be designed to be easily and quickly pressed on the wrist of the user. Certain buttons such as radio buttons appear on most other platforms, but do not appear on WatchOS because they are impractical for the small sized screen. Lastly, clear labeling of buttons (whether in text or image form) are imperative for fast identification of said button.</li>

                        <li><code>Learnability/Memorability:</code>  As described in the appearance section WatchOS buttons generally take the same curved shape, (whether rectangular or circular) and are either clearly labeled with text or an image. This allows new users that are familiar with other apple operating systems to quickly identify the function of particular buttons.</li>
                        <li><code>Efficiency/Errors:</code> These are arguably the most important metrics for buttons. This is because buttons are functional by nature, and their functionality is the number one priority. WatchOS’s use of clearly labeled buttons that all possess a rounded shape helps users quickly recognize them. Additionally, users that are familiar other apple products will already recognize some of the buttons. This leads to both an increase in efficiency and lowers number of errors.</li>
                        <li><code>Satisfaction:</code> Just like on most platforms, the satisfaction metric is less of a concern for buttons on WatchOS. It is more important to make the button efficient and work correctly. </li>

They can contain a label, an image, or a group object. iOS 10 has made major steps to move away from the use typical buttons. iOS 10 relies heavily on new technologies such as 3Dtouch and gesture orientated navigation. These technologies can replace buttons in many areas of the operating system.

                           iOS 10 buttons are always round, rectangular with rounded corners, or an indistinguishable shape (clear background with a title). All iOS 10 buttons have customizable backgrounds, titles, and icons. Apple's libraries provide a large amount of predefined button styles for almost every use case. If Apple's system does not cover a developer specific button use, the developer can design custom buttons. Even then, there are design guidelines to follow. All iOS 10 buttons contain very simple icons with or without capitalized titles, or only capitalized titles. The background color for buttons can differ depending on how the button is being used. In-app buttons tend to have no background color and a distinct title color. Buttons that layer on top of the application will have an white opaque background color. iOS 10 also uses simple border colors with a clear background for some of the buttons.

This is especially important with the watchOS because the apple watch has a small touchscreen. This makes it even more important than usual to have well designed buttons that have a quick response time. This is because most of the user inputs are quick touches, and need to be designed to be easily and quickly pressed on the wrist of the user. Lastly, clear labeling of buttons (whether in text or image form) are imperative for fast identification of said button.</li>

                        <li><code>Learnability/Memorability:</code>  As described in the appearance section WatchOS buttons generally take the same curved shape, (whether rectangular or circular) and are either clearly labeled with text or an image. This allows new users that are familiar with other apple operating systems to quickly identify the function of particular buttons.</li>
                        <li><code>Efficiency/Errors:</code> These are arguably the most important metrics for buttons. This is because buttons are functional by nature, and their functionality is the number one priority. WatchOS’s use of clearly labeled buttons that all possess a rounded shape helps users quickly recognize them. Additionally, users that are familiar other apple products will already recognize some of the buttons. This leads to both an increase in efficiency and lowers number of errors.</li>
                        <li><code>Satisfaction:</code> Just like on most platforms, the satisfaction metric is less of a concern for buttons on WatchOS. It is more important to make the button efficient and work correctly. </li>

This type of button is easily recognizeable and holds in it plain text of the buttons function. Radio buttons are different because they are only mainly when you want to select only one of the multiple options. Just as with check boxes, when radio buttons are pressed they highlight the text of the current selection and make the user feel like the whole section is selected (when the radio button/check box selected, the text is also highlighted next to it). This can ultimately distract the user when in reality all you need to do is see the radio button or check box get selected to make it more clean, however,m this is not the case with Ubuntu Unity.

This should be implemented in because users need to know exactly what they're choosing.Unlike checkboxes, radio buttons should be used ONLY if the user is picking multiple choice at the same time. Radio buttons should only be used for selecting 1 option. In the case of Ubuntu, there appears a highlighted orange-tinted box behind the text of the option being currently selected.</li>

Some checkboxes are arranged in a column, however, as show in the picture below they are used horizontal from one another. As in the radio buttons, there appears a highlighted orange-tinted box behind the text of the option being currently selected but can never be highlighted both at once because it follows the last click</li>

                      <ul>
                        <li><code>Learnability/Memorability:</code>   Learnability/Memorability: Since the button is such a fundamental part of virtually every user interface available today, it can be argued that all usability metrics are equally important for this component. It is almost expected that when users who are seeing a button in a given platform for the first time, should not have any issues recognizing the button and knowing what to do with it (learnability). The high priority of learnability also implies that memorability is a given as well as the overall look helps with memorability if it is unique in its own way.
                        </li>
                        <li><code>Efficiency/Errors:</code>Users must also never experience undue delays with using a button (efficiency), particularly because using a button almost always involves an instantaneous, immediate-result action. Buttons have been almost perfected on other platforms, so there is a general expectation that a button will execute its’ function quickly and accurately. When a user doesn’t receive this they will get frustrated. Users should almost never trigger a button by mistake (errors)—especially buttons whose actions result in significant changes to data or the real world. This can be prevented by having backup messages after a button is clicked to make sure that the user is aware of their press and if they want to continue with it.
                        </li>
                        <li><code>Satisfaction:</code>If any metric at all can be considered as a “low priority” for buttons, it would be satisfaction. The button is such a utilitarian component that “fun” or “enjoyment” is hardly associated with its use. One exception to this prioritization may be for buttons in applications whose primary metric is satisfaction (e.g., games, entertainment). As a part of that overall system, making buttons “fun” may then become more important than in other situations. Overall, satisfaction for buttons is one of those situations where people expect the button to perform a function, and if there is any stray from the expected performance of that button click, the satisfaction goes down.</li>
