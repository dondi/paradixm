<p class="lead">A Task Switcher allows for quick and efficient switching between open programs for a streamlined workflow. There are copius different ways to accomplish this, ranging from quick keyboard shortcuts, to using the command line. </p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">

	<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>
		<p>Although there are many ways to switch between tasks, most operating systems have a similar feature that portrays all currently open programs (or their respective icons) in thumbnails across the screen. They typically prioritize the screen, displaying themselves in front of any and all open windows. Please click <a href="#pSpecific"> here</a> to see examples on different operating systems.

		</p>



	<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>
		<p>
		First, it is important to note that there is a long list of ways a user can switch between tasks. One way would be to use the mouse, locate the task launcher, hover over the task one wants to open, and click. Information on the task launcher can be found <a href="/paradixm/components/task-launcher/">here</a>.</p>

		<p>
		Another more efficient way, which is seen on most Operating Systems, including mobile, is to press and hold a set of keys (i.e. Windows: <code>Alt + Tab</code> ; OSX: <code>Cmd + Tab</code> ; iOS 9 double tap the <code>Home</code> button). While still holding the <code>Cmd</code> or <code>Alt</code> key, the user can keep tapping on <code>Tab</code> to quickly sift through currently open programs. Once the user lets go of all keys, the program that was selected will open. </p>

		<p>It is good to note that this is a very efficient way to jump back and forth between two programs. The end goal is to switch between tasks, and the quicker and more effortless the process is, the better it is for the user. There are many different shortcuts, and other platform-specific ways to allow for further efficient manipulation (i.e. hiding an app) that will be mentioned under the <a href="#pSpecific"> Platform-Specific Instances</a> section.</p>

	<h4>Events</h4>
		<p> The most relevant task switcher event is to select the new open app and switch to it. Because of the simplicity of the action, there should not be a myriad of alternative actions. If a user hovers over a task, it simply becomes <code>selected</code>, and the previous task becomes unselected. Only one task can be selected at a time.

	<h4>State Diagram</h4>
		<p> <img src="img/stateDiagram.png" style="width:90%; height:auto;" alt="State Diagram"> </p> 

		<p> Note that only one task can be selected at a time, so when one task is <code>selected</code> all the others are not. A task must be selected in order fo it to be launched, which occurs on key release or its platform-specific way of selection. However, if the task switcher is <code>active</code> on the screen, a user can always interact with each task, and they are never <code>disabled</code> if the task switcher is open. Please see <a href="#pSpecific"> Platform-Specific Instances</a> for more states. </p>

  	<h3> Typical Behavior (continued) </h4>

  	<h4>Component in Action</h4>

		<p> Below is a video showing off the task switcher in OSX. The taskbar pops up, taking priority of the screen, and the user can navigate to the left or to the right, quit tasks, hide them, or quickly "alt/tab" back and forth between a pair of tasks.

	<h3>Variants</h3>
		<p>Switching tasks is a standard operation on most devices. Below is a list illustrating the broad ways to accomplish task switching:</p>

		<ul>
			<li> <em> Mission Control </em>, an OSX variant, displays all open windows in thumbnail view across the screen. The difference is that there are no shortcuts to navigate between currently open windows, and you get a preview of the conent of each open task, rather than just the task icon. They are not aligned neatly across the middle of the screen, but scattered. A user can click on any task to switch to it. More information can be found in <a href="#pSpecific">Platform-Specific Instances</a>.</li>
			<li> Most smartphones have a task switcher. When launched, gesture-based controls allows the user to cycle through all open apps, and when they find the one they want to open, they tap on it to open it. </li>
			<li> Using <em>Voice Navigation</em> (i.e. Siri) and vocally ask to "open" a specific task. </li>

		</ul>

		There are different components all together that allow switching between apps, some examples are the <a href="/paradixm/components/task-launcher/"> Task Launcher </a>(the user clicks on an application to open it) and the command line.

	<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

		<p>The learnability of task switching should be very quick, as it is a single input (whether it is a gesture, a double tap of a button, or several key entries at once). It may take longer to discover all the features in a task switcher, like hiding or quitting applications, but its main function of switching tasks should be intuitive. Once the task switcher is active, there should be no confusion and no series of extra steps to accompish switching to a different task. </p>

		<p>Efficiency is arguably the most important usability measure, as there should be no delay after launch. Because efficiency is of such high priority, there should be almost no mistakes (errors) from a user to accidentally open the wrong program, as the program selected should be the only one that is switched to.</p>

		<p>Memorability would be the biggest hurdle, as user needs to memorize the input to launch it. Once that one input is memorized, there should not be any confusion on what to do next.</p>

		<p>Satisfaction is of high priority, and is closely tied to efficiency. The user should feel that switching tasks is effortless, and feel a sense of "flow" as they are hopping between tasks.</p>

	<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
	<h4>Feedback</h4>

	<p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a task switcher must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
	  never doubt whether:</p>

	<ol>
	  <li>a current task is highlighted, and ready to be opened on key release.</li>
	  <li>all other tasks are clearly not selected, so as there is no confusion as to which task will be opened.</li>
	</ol>

	<h4> Simplicity </h4>
	<p> Simplicity is a key guideline to implement properly. Upon the task switcher's launch, the user should have no trouble distinguishing which tasks are open, which task is currently selected, what the next selected task would be, and how to open the next selected task. </p>

      	<p> There are two main ways a user can use task switching in OSX. </p>
		<strong>Standard Task Switching</strong>
      	<p>The user presses and holds the <code>CMD</code> button, and taps on <code> Tab</code>. The task switcher pops up, taking screen priority, showing all currently open apps with the current app being highlighted: </p>

		<img src="img/taskSwitch1.png" style="width:100%; height:auto;" alt="OSX Task Switcher 1">

      	<p><em>Note that the app that is highlighted is the only one that has text under it, and has a light grey box that encompasses the icon</em> </p>
      	<p>The user now has multiple options and can
	      	<ul>
	      	<li>Release the keys to switch to the currently open app.</li>
	      	<li>Cycle through the currently open apps:</li>
				<ul>
					<li> to the right by using either <code>Tab</code> or the <code>Right Arrow</code> key.</li>
					<li> to the left by using either <code>Tab + Shift</code> or the <code>Left Arrow</code> key or the <code>`</code> key.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Enter <i> Expose Mode </i> by hitting either the <code>Up</code> or <code>Down</code> arrow key. </li>
			<li>Hide the application by hitting the <code>H</code> key.</li>
			<li>Quit the application by hitting the <code>Q</code> key. </li>
			</ul>
			<p> Although there are many shortcuts to accomplish multiple tasks, for the sake of simply "task switching" only the first three bullet points are relevant. For the sake of completeness, if the user decided to cycle right, the new state would be</p>

			<br>
     	</p>

     	<p>
     		<strong>Mission Control Task Switching</strong>
     		
     		<p>The user either presses the mission control key <img src="img/missionC.png" style="width:3%; height:auto;" alt="F3 key">, enters <code>Control + Up</code> keys, enables swiping gestures (ie four finger swipe up across the trackpad), or presses the <code>up</code> or <code>down</code> arrow keys when the standardk task switcher is active, and launches <em> Mission Control </em> and is greeted with the following view: </p>
			
			<p><img src="img/taskSwitch3.png" style="width:70%; height:auto;" alt="OSX Task Switcher 3"> </p>

			<p>Although there are many neat features in Mission control that have to do with using OSX <em>Spaces </em>, regarding the act of task switching, they are irrelevant as it is more for window management. What is to note is the differences between the two interfaces. Mission Control displays thumbnails where a user can see what is going on inside each and every single app. They are spread across in no particular order, and none of them are highlighted until a user mouses over an app. When a user mouses over an app, a label appears with the app name. A stark contrast to the thin, simple standard task manager that only shows icons and a single selected app.</p>
