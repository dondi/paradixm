</div>

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>
<p>
  Since selecting something is such a common task, there is a typical behavior associated with it. When an item is selected it is usually highlighted in a different color. In terms of computers there are many types of items that can be selectable. For example when selecting text, the user would left click and drag over the desired text to select. For folders and files, a user could mouse over and hover the desired item and see a dim highlight encapsulating the item. If the user wants to select that item they would click on it and the dim highlight would change to a more opaque one, signifying the selection. 
</p>

<p>
  There are also different methods of selecting. Notably when paired with the buttons Shift and Ctrl. 
</p>

<p>
  When using the button Shift while selecting, the user can click where to begin the selection and then use a second click to signify where to end the selection. 
</p>

<p>
  When using the button Ctrl while selecting, the user can click or highlight on separate items and group them as a single selection.
</p>

<h4>Events</h4>
<div class="well">
<p>
  A selecting event is simply the process of clicking or drag-clicking text or items on the screen.
</p>
<p>
  Commonly there are to select one item, the user would click on desired item and thus the item is selected. However if the user wanted to select multiple items, the user would have to drag-click and highlight the section of text or items the wish.

<h3>Variants</h3>
  <p>
  There are many variations of what is selectable and how to select it. There are three main variations.
  </p>
<div class="well">
  <p>
    Text Selecting
  </p>
  <p>
    When performing a text selection, the user goes through three actions:
  </p>

  <p>
    1.) Clicking on-screen where the user would like to begin the selection.
  </p>

  <p>
    2.) Holding the click and dragging the cursor so the desired text is highlighted.
  </p>

  <p>
    3.) Releasing the click and finish the selecting.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <p>
    Folder/File Selecting
  </p>
  <p>
    When selecting multiple folders/files, a user can use the same methodology as text selection. However, when selecting a single file or folder a user just needs to follow two steps.
  </p>

  <p>
    1.) Choosing what folder/file to select and hover over it. Notice there a dim highlight surrounds the folder/file.
  </p>

  <p>
    2.) Click on the desired folder/file. Notice how the dim highlight turned more opaque after clicking.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <p>
    Checkbox Selecting
  </p>
  <p>
    When performing a selection on checkboxes, the user goes through two steps.
  </p>

  <p>
    1.) Choosing which checkbox to select and hover over it. Notice there a dim blue highlight surrounds checkbox.
  </p>

  <p>
    2.) Click on the desired checkbox. Notice a check has appeared in the box.
  </p>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

<div class="well">
  <p>
    Learnability/Memorability: Selecting is a basic and universal task a user can perform on almost all user interfaces today. Because of this selecting something on multiple user interfaces are very similar. The only difference is the types of peripherals are available to the user. Once a user learns to perform selecting with certain peripherals (i.e. mouse or touch screen), then should be able to figure it out on different platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Efficiency/Errors: Selecting is a simple task and therefore should be performed seamlessly and lawlessly. With the selected items or text being highlighted in a noticeable color after selection should improve efficiency because the user will notice the difference. There are additional functions that the user can use to improve their selecting experience which are the Shift and Ctrl buttons on the keyboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Satisfaction: Does not really apply. Users do not find any satisfaction in selecting items in the user interface. Therefore this metric is not needed.
  </p>
</div>


<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
<div class="well">
  There are a few elements that go into a good selecting process. First to select a single target the design should require the user to perform one action (click or tap). Second to select multiple targets the design should have a system in place that builds on top of the single select. For example click to select one target and click and drag to select multiple. 
</div>

<h4>Feedback</h4>
<div class="well">
  <p>Perhaps one most important interaction design principle that selecting something must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
    never doubt whether:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>they did positively select what they wanted to select</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>
<h4>Windows 7</h4>
<div class="well">
  <p>
    Typically in Windows 7, selecting is a very simple task. It supports the three variants of selecting that are detailed above. In the explorer, the user can select through any folder structure, any type of file, and text in any text editor. Windows 7 default color to signify if something is highlighted is blue. However on the desktop a selection of a folder or file is highlighted with a clear outline. These colors are specific to Windows and their operating system. An application that is run in Windows could have a different color to signify a selection. Above in the typical appearances is where some selection is done in Windows 7. Also the addition functions of Shift and Ctrl are allowed in Window 7 where Shift selects from a start and end, while Ctrl allows multiple selections of single targets.
  </p>
</div>

<h4>Android ~ 4.4.4 ~ Kitkat</h4>
<div class="well">
  <p>
    Typically in Android, selecting is different than operating systems like Windows and OSX. It does support the three variants that are explained above. However since there is no mouse the user has to rely on touch. To select a single target, usually the user would have to press and hold until more option pop up. To select multiple targets is the same process however the user would just select more. Selecting on Android 4.4.4 is very seamless and self explanatory. The user knows when something is selected because there more options and menus will pop up in response to the long press.

<p style="text-align: center"> Selecting is usually seen as blue highlights for text and a white half-opaque rim around a file icon.</p> 


<h3> Typical Behavior <small> how it usually behaves </small> </h3>

<p> When a user selects, the most typical appearance is that the item itself highlights in a different color. However for different items the selection will look different. 
</p>

<p>For text, the cursor turns into a text cursor as the mouse hovers over. When the user clicks and drags the mouse, it is then that the choosen characters highlight in a different color.
</p>

<p> For items such as folders and files, when the item is clicked the a rim halo appears around the folder to signify that the computer is currently focusing on that particular object. It is from there that the user can choose to open it and do other commands with it.</p>

<h4> Events </h4>			
<div class="row"> 	
	
	<div class="col-sm-6">
		<div class="well"> 
			<p> <b> Text selection </b>: When text-selecting the major actions is clicking, dragging, and letting go. 
				<ul>
					<li> Click: The click signifies the beginning of the selection. As the user is hovering over the text, the mouse cursor will then turn into a text cursor. That is usually the sign that a user is able to do a text selection. Another event that occurs due to clicking is after the user has made their selection if they click without holding down the command or shift keys they will unselet that particular item. </li>

					<li> Dragging: From the starting point, the user drags along the text to the last point of where they would like to select. Whereever the mouse hovers during this dragging state is what is selected. </li> 

					<li> Letting go: When the user reaches the end of their selection, by letting go they signify that that is the end of what they choose. At this point the cursor now turns back into a normal mouse cursor and the text that they would like to select is in blue. It is from this step that the user can do whatever action they would like with the text, whether that is copying it to the clipboard etc. </li>

			<ul>
				<li> Click: When the user clicks on the icon that they would like, that is when the item highlights and it signifies that it is selected. For most computers, when holding down shift and command keys, more items can be selected. When a file is seleected, if a user clicks on an area that is not another file or the same sort of icon, it will deselect the selection. </li>

<h3> Variants <small> how it varies per location </small> </h3>
	<p> Though the act of selecting is very similar, how it displays can be different depending on the user preference. In a computer interface, selecting is done primarily with clicking and dragging. Meanwhile for touch devices, selecting is done primarily with taps and holds. 
	</p> 
	<p>
		Depending on the user preferences, selecting's apperance may change to different colors. 
	</p>

<h3> Priority Metrics <small> Selecting and its Usability Metrics </small> </h3>

	<p> Selecting is something in which learnability, memorability, as well as errors are very important metrics. Users use selecting to do other functions and being able to quickly select to go to the next action is very important. Being able to learn how to select quickly as well as efficiently is important. Also because selecting is a prior action needed for other commands such as copying or moving files, the quicker it is to get selection done is also very important (efficiency). Also if the user has not done this in a while this information should be easily recalled (memorability). Errors should also be very low, for if there are any errors in selection it could lead to dire consequences such as deleting files or overwriting data. 
	</P> 
	<p> The only metric that is not as important is satisfaction. This is because selecting is a much more utilitarian action and component and the user's enjoyment does not vary with selecing. The user could get annoyed if selecting is not memorable or efficient but the act of selecting does not need satsifaction for it to be a great component. </p> 

<h3> Key Chararacteristics <small> What do all great selections have? </small> </h3>
	 <ul>
	 	<li> Prevent Errors: Users should be forgiven if they select the wrong items. They should be able to deselect objects that they no longer need or add more selections. </li>
	 	<li> Feedback: When trying to select, the user should get immediate feedback as to what he or she is selecting. Also they should know if what they are tapping/clicking is selectable. That way the user's mental model of selectable items will be consistent to the designer's mental model. </li>
	 	<li>Consistency: The actions that are required for selecting a certain type of object should be consistent that way selecting will have a higher level of memorability as well as efficiency. If they were different then it will confuse the user and complicate their mental model of selecting. </li>
	 	<li> Shortcuts: To help with the efficiency of selecting, shortcuts should be added to allow users to select a large amount of objects at once. For example, control+A is a common shortcut that is used to select all of the text. </li>
	 </ul>

			<h3> iOS iPhone4s </h3>
			<p> For iOS, selecting is a little tricker. Unlike on a laptop where a user is able to click and drag, the user must use a combinations of different taps, holds, and drags in order to select different items. Also for iOS the only selection items are texts and images. Unlike computers, there are no files, instead they are apps that one must tap to open. </p>
			<h4> Appearance</h4>
			<p>User clicks and holds down in front of text and a magnifying like glass appears showing where the text selector is. </p>
			<img src="images/iphone_textSelection1.png" style= "height: 50%; width:50%;" class="img-responsive" alt="text selection in notes image 1">
			<p> After releasing hold, an option for Selecting and other options appear, as seen in the image below.</p>
			<img src="images/iphone_textSelection2.png" style= "height: 50%; width:50%;"class="img-responsive" alt="text selection in notes image 2">
			<p>After tapping on select, the user is able to tap and drag either ends of the selecting blue vertical bars and move them around to make their selection</p>
			<img src="images/iphone_textSelection3.png" style= "height: 50%; width:50%;"class="img-responsive" alt="text selection in notes image 3">
			<p> When there is no more action, a dialog menu pops up asking for what action the user would like to do next.</p>
			<img src="images/iphone_textSelection4.png" style= "height: 50%; width:50%;"class="img-responsive" alt="text selection in notes image 4">
