  <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="overview" aria-labelledby="overview-tab">
    <div id="overview" class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h3><strong>Typical Appearance</strong></h3>
          <p>Task Launchers frequently appear one of the edges of the screen (in accordance with Fitts' Law), usually
            as a collapsable menu or a static menu. These menus are generally populated with icons representing runnable
            programs, and sometimes show additional search or organizational features.</p>
        <h3><strong>Typical Behavior</strong></h3>
          <p>Generally implemented as a graphical menu, the task launcher's primary purpose is to allow the user to initiate
            tasks, most frequently by launching programs. The user can use the task launcher to immediately run exectuable programs
            rather than manually search through the file system to find the executable, which dramatically improves the efficiency of
            launching programs and reduces errors. Moreover, it allows new users to bypass the somewhat complicated file/path
            system, improving learnability. A well designed task launcher may even have built in search or organizational capabilities
            that greatly enhance the user's experience using the operating system.</p>
        <h4>State Diagram</h4>
          <p>Below is a generalized state diagram that applies to most task-launchers. It is by no means exhaustive, only illuminating
            the broad strokes of task launching</p>
          <figure class="figure">
            <img src="state-diagram.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><strong>General State Diagram of Task Launchers</strong></figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h3><strong>Events</strong></h3>
          <p>Typically, a task launcher remains idle until the user opens up the task menu. Second, the user must show intent by either
            closing the menu, or clicking a program or file. If the user closes out, the launcher will return to idle. If the user clicks
            on a program or file, the launcher will run a program and return to idle. Some launchers have more events possible, but they
            all boil down to the same core event chain.
        <h3><strong>Component in Action</strong></h3>
        <h5>Ubuntu 12.04</h5>
          <p>The following video demonstrates the use of the Ubuntu task launcher at 00:19.</p>
          <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
            <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LzcJxpt9-Ic?t=19s" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>
          <p>As you can see in the clip, the dock on the left side of the screen launches applications. The first launch is completed
            by clicking one of the icons, in this instance Google Chrome. The second launch of an application utilizes the secondary
            launcher, which includes a list of recently launched apps, as well as a search bar for textual input. The Ubuntu task
            launcheer mirrors Windows 10 in the use of the Operating System logo to open another task launcher.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h3><strong>Variants</strong></h3>
          <p>Some operating systems have a task launching menu that pops when you click an icon, while others have the menu always visible
            on the side of the screen. In each type, the task launcher shows a handfull of frequently used runnable programs. In addition
            to this menu, some operating systems also have a search option, which can help the user find programs that might be less
            frequently used. There are also countless third-party task launchers that support specific types of workflows and have special
            capabilities.</p>

        <h3><strong>Priority Metrics</strong></h3>
          <h4>Satisfaction</h4>
          <p>The Satisfaction of the user is critical to the task launcher's success. An operating system with a clunky and inneficient task
            launcher will definitely not be successful. More specifically, useful features which allow for greater use of the task launcher,
            such as search bars, can often give the user a more enjoyable experience with the operating system.</p>
          <h4>Efficiency &amp; Learnability</h4>
          <p>Efficiency and learnability are the most relevant metrics of a task launcher. The only reason task launchers exist is to give
            users a quicker and easier way to launch tasks, so if they are inefficient or hard to learn, they are unusable. Without a usable
            task launcher, the entire operating system would lose its usefullness.</p>
          <h4>Memorability &amp; Errors</h4>
          <p>Memorability and errors are not very relevant to the overall usability of a task launcher, mainly because task launchers were
            largely made to reduce errors and eliminate the need for memorability. Without a task launcher, the user would have to remember how to
            find every program manually, while trying not to get lost of mistep the entire way. The task launcher bypasses that entire difficult
            process, so it would prove quite hard to create an error ridden task launcher that also doesn't satisfy memorability .</p>

        <h3><strong>Key Characteristics</strong></h3>
         <p>Good task launchers are fast and easy to use, and the best task launchers are intuitive. Ideally, the user would tell it what to run and
           it would instantly initiate the task. These desired qualities make it clear that the learnability and efficiency of a task launcher determine
           its success. The overall usability of a task launcher is one of the most important factors of an operating system, since the task launcher
           plays an integral part to portray the mental model of the computer architecture to the user. For this reason, task managers are usually the
           starting point for any modern human computer interface.</p>

          <p>
            The dock allows for the immediate launch of any application or folder stored on it with a
            simple click. Spotlight requires keyboard input instead.
          </p>
        <h3><strong>Events</strong></h3>
          <p>
            During the use of a task launcher the user is required to type in the name of a desired file or application.
            Once the text input is received the task launcher takes one of three actions:<br>
             1. opens desired file <br>
             2. launches application <br>
             3. responds with a "file/application not found" message <br>

            There are third-party task launchers that have been developed specifically for Mac OS X, namely "Alfred." Alfred
            includes many different features not included in spotlight or the dock; it can save your passwords, create workflows
            and even search the web.
          </p>
        <h3><strong>Priority Metrics</strong></h3>
        <h4><u>Efficiency &amp; Learnability</u></h4>
          <p>
            Mac OS X task launchers have a help application built in which increases their learnability by teaching the the
            user how to use the interface. Additionally the efficiency of the dock and spotlight is increased by built in shortcuts
            that can be accessed in any application.
          </p>
        <h4><u>Satisfaction</u></h4>
          <p>
            The satisfaction of the Mac task launchers is based on the speed and ease of use, or more specifically the efficiency and
            learnability. The user can always look to third-party applications in the case of Mac OS X.

        <h3><strong>Key Characteristics</strong></h3>
          <p>
            Spotlight and dock allow for two different communications between the user and the operating system. The dock's immediacy
            and simplicity makes it a great option for the launching of everyday tasks. Spotlight's access to all applications and
            files stored on the system allows for the fast launch of applications and the opening of files that are note regularly
            accessed. It drastically decreases the overall time of launching applications not stored in the dock and creates convenient
            shortcut to any location in the operating system.

        <h3>Variants</h3>
          <p>
            There are many different third party task launchers offered for Windows 10, each offering its own set of unique features. A popular launcher is
            <a href="http://www.launchy.net/index.php">Launchy</a>. Launchy is a pure task launcher focusing on opening files and applications quickly (efficiently).
          </p>
        <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
          <h4>Satisfaction</h4>
            <p>
              The satisfaction of the Windows 10 task launcher is based more in customization than many other task launchers (focused on the speed and ease of use).
              In terms of usability metrics, the efficiency is heavily prioritized over learnability. The settings are not intutive and there are many features
              available that most users overlook. However, experienced users will be very satisfied with the ability to place exactly what they want where they want
              with little limitation.
            </p>
          <h4>Efficiency</h4>
            <p>
              The Windows 10 task launcher has sacrificed some learnability for efficiency. This sacrifice makes the efficiency of the Windows 10 task launcher very
              important. Once the user has spent time learning how to manipulate the system, the user is able to very quickly perform an application or file launch.
              The user can also customize the task launcher to meet their needs, making specific tasks more efficient but less learnable.
            </p>
          <h4>Learnability</h4>
            <p>
              Learnability is not totally ignored in the Windows 10 task launcher. The icons and labels make it easy for a first time user to navigate. The mental
              model of a start menu is, for many, a cornerstone of their first interaction with a computer. Windows 10's start menu follows the basics of that model,
              performing the same general purpose, while supplying many bells and whistles.

      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
         <p>

                  <h3><strong>Behavior</strong></h3>
                    <p>The dock allows for the immediate launch of any application or folder stored on it with a simple click. Spotlight requires keyboard input instead.</p>
                  <h3><strong>Events</strong></h3>
                    <p>During the use of a task launcher the user is required to type in the name of a desired file or application. Once the text input is received the task launcher takes one of three actions:<br>
                       1. opens desired file <br>
                       2. launches application <br>
                       3. responds with a "file/application not found" message <br>
                          when an application is in use, a dot appears underneath its icon on the dock.

                  <h3><strong>Variants</strong></h3>
                    <p>There are third-party task launchers that have been developed specifically for Mac OS X, namely "Alfred." Alfred includes many different features not included in spotlight or the dock; it can save your passwords, create workflows and even search the web.</p>
                  <h3><strong>Priority Metrics</strong></h3>
                  <h4><u>Efficiency &amp; Learnability</u></h4>
                    <p>Mac OS X task launchers have a help application built in which increases their learnability by teaching the the user how to use the interface. Additionally the efficiency of the dock and spotlight is increased by built in shortcuts that can be accessed in any application.</p>
                  <h4><u>Satisfaction</u></h4>
                    <p>The satisfaction of the Mac task launchers is based on the speed and ease of use, or more specifically the efficiency and learnability. The user can always look to third-party applications in the case of Mac OS X.  </p>

                  <h3><strong>Key Characteristics</strong></h3>
                    <p>Spotlight and dock allow for two different communications between the user and the operating system. The dock's immediacy and simplicity makes it a great option for the launching of everyday tasks. Spotlight's access to all applications and files stored on the system allows for the fast launch of applications and the opening of files that are note regularly accessed. It drastically decreases the overall time of launching applications not stored in the dock and creates a convenient shortcut to any location in the operating system.</p>

              <h3>Variants</h3>

A popular launcher is <a href="http://www.launchy.net/index.php">Launchy</a>. Launchy is a pure task launcher focusing on opening files and applications quickly (efficiently).</p>
              <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
                <h4>Satisfaction</h4>
                 <p>The satisfaction of the Windows 10 task launcher is based more in customization than many other task launchers (focused on the speed and ease of use). In terms of usability metrics, the efficiency is heavily prioritized over learnability. The settings are not intutive and there are many features available that most users overlook. However, experienced users will be very satisfied with the ability to place exactly what they want where they want with little limitation.</p>
                <h4>Efficiency</h4>
                 <p>The Windows 10 task launcher has sacrificed some learnability for efficiency. This sacrifice makes the efficiency of the Windows 10 task launcher very important. Once the user has spent time learning how to manipulate the system, the user is able to very quickly perform an application or file launch. The user can also customize the task launcher to meet their needs, making specific tasks more efficient but less learnable. </p>
                <h4>Learnability</h4>
                 <p>Learnability is not totally ignored in the Windows 10 task launcher. The icons and labels make it easy for a first time user to navigate. The mental model of a start menu is, for many, a cornerstone of their first interaction with a computer. Windows 10's start menu follows the basics of that model, performing the same general purpose, while supplying many bells and whistles.</p>
              <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
               <p>The Windows 10 start menu and task bar allow for the user to almost completely customize their interaction with the system. The complexity of the start menu makes it less learnable than many task launchers, but eventually makes up for it with quicker launch times (based on customizations). The start menu and task bar can contain shortcuts to files or applications and really make an app launch immediate. The ability to change the size of icons in the start menu takes advantage of Fitts's Law, as does the location of the task bar itself. Overall, the Windows 10 task launcher strives for usability through satisfaction and efficiency. Prioritizing customizability satisfies users and (depending on the user) allows some tasks to become more efficient.
