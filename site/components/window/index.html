<p class="lead"> Not to be confused with Microsoft Windows, a window
is a rectangular shape that displays content on a computer monitor. It is a very common component. In fact, a window is used to view the content of this page! 
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">

<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>
  <blockquote>The appearance of a standard window varies across different
  platforms.

  Windows are made out of the following components:
  <br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Frame</li>
    <img src="Frame.png" alt="An example of a frame" width="400">
    <small>An example of the "Frame"</small>
    <br><br>
    <li> Content</li>
    <img src="Content.png" alt="An example of content of a window" width="400">
    <small>An example of the "Content"</small>
    <br><br>
  </ul>
  In the frame there are buttons located on the top left corner or top right corner, depending on the platform. (<em>See <a href="#Yosemite">Platform Specific Content</a></em>) There is a slight variation on the frame depending on what type of window one is accessing. <em>(See the <a href="#variants">'Variant Appearance'</a> section below.)</em> Generally in the middle of the frame, there is a title containing the name of the content.
  <br> <br>
  The content component of  the window, varies greatly and is dependent upon the type of window you are accessing. Depending on the platform one is using the frame might envelope the content and acting in a literal sense like a frame. <em>See <a href="#Yosemite">Platform Specific Content</a></em>)

<h3 id="variants">Variant Appearance</h3>
  <blockquote> There are five common variants of windows. <ol>
    <li>File Explorer</li>
    <img src="GeneralWindow.PNG" alt="picture of File Explorer Window" height="200">
    <blockquote>The file explorer window is usually accessed when one clicks a folder on their computer. There are three buttons located in the frame of the window. On most platforms you can change the layout of the content with buttons usually found in the frame.  </blockquote>
    <li>Dialog</li>
    <img src="dialog.PNG" alt="A picture of a Dialog Window" width="400">
    <blockquote>The dialog window usually appears the computer prompts the user for input in the form of button or string input. In the frame there will either be one or no buttons depending on the platform.</blockquote>
    <li>Alert</li>
    <img src="alert.PNG" alt="A picture of a alert Window"  width="400">
    <blockquote>The alert window occurs when the computer wants to notify the user of an action or a warning. It prompts the user for input in the form of a single button signaling that the user acknowledges the message. In its frame there will either be a single or no button. </blockquote>
    <li>Properties</li>
    <img src="Properties.PNG" alt="A picture of a Properties window" height="200">
    <blockquote>The properties windows is usally accesed when one wants to edit the properties of a local file. The content of the window contains tabs that changes the content of the window. It also displays various information about the file. </blockquote>
    <li>Application</li>
    <img src="Application.PNG" alt="A picture of an Application window" height="200">
    <blockquote>Out of the four categories of windows, the appearance of an application windows varies greatly due to the nature of 3rd party developers. For most application windows they use the standard frame.</blockquote>
  </ol> 

  </blockquote>

  <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
  <blockquote>As a common and fundamental component in modern graphic user interfaces, the window compoent mainly focuses on four out of the five usability metrics:
	<ul>
		<li>Learnability</li>
		<small>A user seeing a window on any platform must not have any problems learning how it operates as it is the most common way to navigate through the computer's directory and to access files and to view content. </small>
		<li>Efficiency</li>
		<small>If a window delays, the user might make the mistake in trying to reopen the window. The result could be the opening of multiple windows. If this happens to be an Application window it could greatly slow down the computer.</small>
		<li>Errors</li>
		<small>A user must not trigger an error with a window. This is especially so with an application window. The error could cause the user's work to be deleted.</small>
		<li>Memorability</li>
		<small>Because a window is an important graphic user interface component, it would be tedious and counter-productive if the user is unable to remember how to use the component</small>
		
	</ul>
	The last metric, <strong>satisfaction</strong>, is the least important because of window's commonality and simplicity. Not much pleasure can be derived from the functionality of a window.
  </blockquote>
<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
<h4>Clarity</h4>
<blockquote> There should be a title in the middle of the frame in order for the user to get a better understanding of the content being displayed. For a dialog and alert window it is extremely important for the message to be concise and easily understandable.</blockquote>
<h4>Consistency</h4>
<blockquote>This mainly applies to Application windows. The Application window should adopt the stylings and appearance of a typical window of the specific platform it is running on.</blockquote>
<h4>Feedback</h4>
<blockquote>There should be some kind of response indicating that a user is opening a window. If there is such a delay the user could accidently open various windows. For application windows there should be confirmation if the user would like to close a window in the form of a dialog window. This is especially the case if the user is modifying a file in the content of a window.</blockquote>

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<!-- Events Section -->
<h4>Events</h4>
<h5>The frame buttons</h5>
  <blockquote> The three buttons in the frame exhibit three different behaviors.
  <img src="Three-buttons.PNG" alt="The three buttons within the frame">
  <ul><li>When the button to the outermost left is <code>clicked</code> the window closes. This is called <code>exiting</code> the window.</li>
  <li>The button in the middle hides the window in the dock/menubar. This is called <code>minimizing</code> the window. The window can be accessed again by clicking it in within the dock/menu bar. This is called <code>restoring</code> the window.</li>
  <li>The button on the right <code>maximizes</code> the window, making the window's height and width the size of the screen. If clicked again the window will be <code>restored</code> to it's original size</li>
  <em>(For more info on the button component see <a href="../button/index.html">button</a>)</em>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <h5>The frame</h5>
  <blockquote><ul>
    <li>If you click and hold the frame, you are able to move the window by dragging your mouse</li>
    <li>By double clicking the the frame you can expand or compress the size of the window. As to how big it varies from different platforms.</li>
  </ul></blockquote>
  <br>
  <h5>The window</h5>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>When one's mouse is at the edge of the window, the user is notified that the window can be resized. This is signified by the mouse changing its shape.</li> <ul>
        <li>When this happens if the user clicks and hold, by dragging the mouse one is able to change the size of the window precisely. (<em>For more information see <a href="../resizing/index.html">resizing</a></em>)</li>
      </ul>
      
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <h4>State Diagram</h4>
  <img src="StateDiagram.png" alt="State Diagram of a window" width="600">
  	<blockquote>The window component has five states: 
	<ul>
		<li><code>active</code></li>
		<li><code>passive</code></li>
		<li><code>minimized</code></li>
		<li><code>maximized</code></li>
		<li><code>closed</code></li>
	</ul>
  	 
  	<br>
	<img src="Selected-Deselected.png" alt="An example of an active and passive window" height="300">
	<br><br>
	When a window is opened it is in its <code>active</code> state by default. In this scenario we will call this <strong>window 1</strong>. In this state <strong>window 1's</strong> you are able to either <code>maximize</code>, <code>minimize</code> or <code>exit</code> the window. 
	<br><br>
	<img src="Diagram-1.png" alt="A single window open" height="200" width="400">
	<br><br>
	
	When the <strong>window 1</strong> is in its <code>maximized</code> state, the window expands to the size of ones computer monitor. Depending on the platform used a window can be <code>minimized</code> or <code>exited</code> in this state. By clicking the <code>maximize</code> button the user can restore the window to it's original size.

	<br><br>
	
	When the minimize button is clicked, <strong>window 1</strong> enters <code>minimized</code> state. In this state the window disappears and it resides in the dock/menu bar. If you click the <code>minimized</code> window in the dock/menu bar it restores in size.

	<br><br>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRtMpZDEk1o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<br><br>
<hr>
	Lets assume the user opens up another window called <strong>window 2</strong>. When this happens <strong>window 1</strong> is in it's <code>passive</code> state while <strong>window 2</strong> would be in its active. The user is alerted to this change when <strong>window 1</strong> appears to grayer than <strong>window 2</strong>. 
	<br><br>
	<img src="Diagram-2.png" alt="A single window open" width="400">
	<br><br>
	If the user clicks <strong>window 1</strong>, then <strong>window 2</strong> would become passive while <strong>window 1</strong> would be active.
	<br><br>
	<img src="Diagram-3.png" alt="A single window open" width="400">
	<br><br>
	
	If the user opens up another window, in which we will call <strong>window 3</strong>, both <strong>window 1</strong> and <strong>window 2</strong> will be in its passive state and <strong>window 3</strong> will be in its active state.
	<br><br>
	<img src="ThreeWindows.png" alt="An active window and two passive windows" width="400">
	<br> <br>
	When <strong>window 1</strong> and <strong>window 2</strong> are in its passive state, it acts like a background. In that <strong>window 3</strong> and windows in a passive state can overlap with <strong>window 3</strong> being on top.
	<br>
	<br>
	<img src="ActiveOverlap.png" alt="An example of active passive window overlap"  width="400">
	<br>
	<br>
	</blockquote>
  	
  	<h4><strong><em>Additional Behavior</em></strong></h4>
  		<h5>File Explorer</h5>
		<blockquote>Along with the events described in the above. In the frame of a File Explorer there is an option to search for files on your computer or folder.  How this is implemented varies across platforms.  <em>(For more information please see the platform section below)</em>

		<br>
		<br>
		Included in the frame exists a back and foward button. When clicked The content of the window changes to the previously viewed content if the back button is clicked. And the foward button opens the content currently viewed.
		<br> <br>

		In the content there exists a menu that allows quick access to directories. By clicking one of the options, the content of with window will change to the content of the directory shortcut you clicked. The directory shortcut menu is customizable.</blockquote>
		
		
		<h5>Dialog</h5>
		<blockquote>Unlike the File Explorer, Properties and Application windows, the Dialog window lacks a <code>maximize</code> button and a <code>minimize</code> button. Depending on the platform it may not even include an <code>exit</code> button.</blockquote>

		<h5>Alert</h5>
		<blockquote>Much like the dialog button, the Alert button lacks a <code>maximize</code>, <code>minimize</code> and possibly an <code>exit</code> button. However in contrast with the other types of windows when the Alert window is in its passive state it does not behave like a background. This window will always be on top of all windows.</blockquote>

		<h5>Application</h5>
		<blockquote>The most Application windows will behave as described above in the typical behavior sections as well as adopting to the nuinces of the platform.</blockquote>
