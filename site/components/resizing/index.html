<p class="lead">A critical feature of GUI-based operating systems is the ability to resize elements.</p>

    <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>
    <p><b>A resize event is characterized by a change in an element's dimensions.</b></p>

    <p>In contrast with zoom, which is a related feature, resize changes the
      dimensional properties (length and width) of the element itself, rather
      than the scope at which the element is displayed on a screen. Examples of
      commonly resized elements include windows, icons, images, and text. However,
      for the purposes of evaluating typical appearances and behavior, we will
      consider the resize behavior of windows.</p>

    <p>The arrow mouse cursor and resize buttons are the most common interface
      elements for changing the dimensions of elements.</p>

    <h3>Typical Behavior</h3>
    <p>There are two categories of window resize behavior: manual and automatic.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-6">
        <div class="panel panel-default">
          <div class="panel-heading">
            <h4 class="panel-title text-center">Manual</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>The dimensions of a window can be manually resized by a drag and
              drop operation using the arrow resize cursor.
              Entering manual resize mode is visually represented by a change in
              the mouse cursor icon's apprearance from a pointer to an arrow.
              The orientation of the arrow, indicates the direction of resize,
               whether horizontal, veritical or diagonal.Once in the resize stage,
               the perimeter of the window can be manipulated.</p>
            <h5>Events</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><code><b>hover</b></code></li>
              <p>The mouse event of <code>hover</code>ing over the perimeter of
                a window changes the cursor to an arrow which indicates the
                allowed direction of resize. When the cursor is an arrow,
                the user is in the <code>resize</code> state.<p>
              <li><code><b>mouse down</b></code></li>
              <p>A mouse down event, once in the <code>resize</code> state,
                begins  manual resize. While in <code>mouse down</code>, changes
                in the position of the mouse will manipulate the dimension of
                the window. The dimension change is visually rendered in real time.</p>
              <li><code><b>mouse release</b></code></li>
              <p>Upon arriving at the desired dimension in <code>mouse down</code>,
                <code>mouse release</code> will set the window dimension and exit
                the <code>resize</code> state.</p>

              resize cursor, which indicates the direction of resize possible.
              Manual resize is permitted within the boundaries set by the platform,
              which default to the screen size. Overrides to the default max size
              on the macOSX platform are that the window can only be resized up to
              the menu bar at the top and up to the dock at the left.</p>

      <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
      <p>Ben Shneiderman, in his book <em>Designing the User Interace</em> defines
        learnability, efficiency, errors, memorability, and satisfaction, as metrics
        by which the usability of a system can be measured. Resize is a common
        interface component, and in a perfect system, all five metrics are important.
        Nevertheless, if the resize function as a user interface component is
        evaluated against these metrics, learnability, efficiency, and memorability
        rise as the most important, whereas errors and satisfaction are less important.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><h4>Lernability </h4></li>
        <p>Learnability is an extremely important metric for effective resize
          interaction design. Resize is a very utilitarian interaction that is
          essential to GUI-based systems. Thus, resize needs to have a short
          learning curve, with interface elements and symbols that are largely
          self-explanatory. For example, users who are manually resizing windows
          for the first time should be able to use a simple guess and check heuristic
          to determine the position at which the mouse should be to achieve the
          intended resize direction.</p>
        <li><h4>Errors</h4></li>
        <p>Because resize is commonly implemented as direct manipulation, errors
          rank lower in the priority metrics. By nature, direct manipulation can
          be easily reversed, giving the user confidence that a mistake can be
          easily fixed. Therefore, errors are less of a concern in manual resize,
           since errors in resize do not carry large consequences.</p>
        <li><h4>Efficiency</h4></li>
        <p>Efficiency is a key metric for effective resize interaction design.
          Feedback is integral for direct manipulation resize, and any delay in
          recieving the visual feedback of element resize will affect the user's
          productivity.</p>
        <li><h4>Memorability</h4></li>
        <p>Because learnability is such a high priority, memorability is also an
          important usability metric. The symbols and colors of resize interface
          elements should allow for the user to easily identify the functionality
          of these elements, from prior knowledge of interfacing with the element.</p>
        <li><h4>Satisfaction</h4></li>
        <p>Because resize is utilitarian in nature, satisfaction is lower on the
          priority list. However, it is important to note that as a subset of
          direct manipulation, good resize user interfaces are integral to the
          satisfaction of the user. For example, if the feedback is delayed in
          manual resize of a window, the user will quickly become frustrated by the
          disconnect between the dimension of the window as displayed on the screen,
           and the user's mental model of how large or small the window should actually be.</p>
      </ul>

    <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
    <h4>Direct Manipulation Interaction Style</h4>

    <p>Direct manipulation is an interaction style in which the changes that a
        user makes to an object are incrementable, reversible, and immediately
        represented on the screen. Manual resize is a classic example of direct
        manipulation. When a user resizes an element's dimensions manually, the
        impact of the change is visible immediately and continually on the user's
        screen. Thus, key characteristics of effective manual resize will be
        discussed in the context its classification as a direct manipulation
        implementation. Well implemented direct manipulation allows the user to
        achieve mastery of the interface, competence in performing tasks, and
        enjoyment in using the interface. The following principles and guidelines
        are relevant for informing best practices for resize interfaces.</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Principle of Feedback</li>

      <p>Feedback is a defining interaction design principle of effective direct
          manipulation. Feedback in manual resize is characterized by a change in
          element's size on the screen in real time, as the user is resizing.
          Feedback time must be sufficiently fast, as any latency in the response
          will cause a delay in the user action - visual response feedback loop.

      <li>Principle of Transparency</li>

      <p>In effective direct manipulation, the interaction tool itself becomes
          transparent to the user. As a direct manipulation interface, resize
          "tools" disappear as the user interaction with the element being
          resized through the mouse cursor is understood as an extension of a
          user's tactile functions, emphasizing the "direct"-ness of direct
          manipulation.</p>

      <li>Mental Model</li>

      <p>Overall, effective interaction design must allow for the user's mental
          model derived from the system image to correspond with the designer's
          mental model. Assisting this process in manual resize is the parallels
          that digifal direct manipulation has with how users interact with the
          physical world. Physically resizing a moldable substance, such as clay
          or elastic is mirrored in the "grasping" <code>mouse down</code> and
          "stretching" <code>resize state</code> of a window or element on a screen.

              <h4>macOS Human Interface Guidelines</h4>
              <p>In this section, the resize component implmentation in the
                  <b>Mac OSX</b> platform will be specifically evaulated.
                  Specific examples of resize implementations will be provided,
                  as well as a discussion of how Apple's interaction design
                  principles have influenced these specific resize implmentations.
                  "macOS Human Interface Guidelines" is a document that provides
                  insight into the theories, principles, and guidelines that Apple
                  Developers use to design the macOS interface. One guideline that
                  it states specifically for resize, is that standard document
                  windows should have transient resize controls--controls that
                  disappear when not needed. The interface guidelines also
                  considers the principle of direct manipulation as a way of
                  affirming the user's mental model of a task, because it can
                  feel more natural than what they define as "explicit tasks".</p>

                    <h4>Automatic Resize</h4>
                    <p>This example shows automatic resize in the Notes Application
                        Window. Hovering over the colored buttons reveals the resize
                        symbol, and upon click of the green fullscreen button,
                        the window fills the entire screen. The fullscreen symbol
                        is indicative of the function it triggers, because of the
                        arrows that are pointing outwards. In fullscreen mode,
                        the entire menu disappears, reflecting the macOS guideline
                        of transient controls. When the user wants to return to
                        a non-fullscreen mode, the resize button is accessed by
                        displaying the menu bar, which returns to the screen when
                        the mouse is at the top of the screen. Hovering over the
                        button reveals the resize symbol, which is now arrows that
                        are pointing inward, indicating that the window will now
                        shrink upon click. </p>

                    <h4>Manual Resize</h4>
                    <p>This example shows manual resize in the Notes Application
                        Window. Hovering over the permeter of the window changes the
                        mouse cursor from a pointer to an arrow, which is indicative
                        of the direction of resize possible at that position. Dragging
                        the edge of the window at this point allows the user to explore
                        different window dimensions, befre setting the new dimension on
                        mouse release. An interesting characteristic to notice is that
                        resizing the Notes window will cause text wrap to occur, bounded
                        by the dimensions of the Notes Window. Also, observe how resize
                        causes the menu bar to add/drop components on stretch/shrink, respectively.
                        Thus, for some applications in OSX, resize not only acts on the window size
                        itself, but on a network of interconnected components that will also
                        react to the resize operation. In this case, as a consequence
                        of the resize, the menu bar automatically reformats as the window is resized.
                        Furthermore, the sidebar hides automattically as its parent window is
                        resizedits there's more room for content.</p>

                           <p>A dialog is a type of window that’s designed to elicit
                                a response from the user. Many dialogs—the Print dialog,
                                for example—let the user provide several responses
                                at once. When a dialog permits resizing, elements
                                that can scale with the dialog do so accordingly
                                to maintain consistency. In general, views like boxes,
                                tab views, and tables, expand to fill the dialog.
                                Other elements that aren’t generally resized,
                                like buttons, checkboxes, and segmented controls
                                remain the same size and are anchored to the sides

                          <p>Direct manipulation occurs at a higher level of abstraction
                              in this example of a slider that accomplishes resizing the
                              dock and its icons by means of a resize slider. The user
                              is manipulating the position of the slider to control the
                              size of the dock. Although the user is a acting on the

                           <p>A split view manages the presentation of two or more panes
                                of content. Each pane can contain any variety of elements,
                                including buttons, tables, column views, text fields, and

                            <p>The panes of a split are separated by a divider that
                                can typically be dragged to resize the panes.
                                Each pane can have a minimum and maximum size,
                                which affects how much it can be resized. Many
                                apps let the user hide specific panes on request.</p>

                            <p>When a user whans to split a screen, the user should
                                hover over the colored buttons that reveals the resize

                                fullscreen button and hold it along the edge of
                                the screen until a box appears showing the new
                                dimensions of the window in light bleu. At this point the user
                                can release the window, which will fill the projected box.
                                At this poing, the rest of the windows will
                                automatically be shown on the remainding half of the screen,
                                indicating the user that he/she should select another
                                window to cover the remaining space. These actions
                                requires direct manipulation of the window in the
                                action of dragging the window to its new location,
                                however the projected box takes over the resizing

                            <p>When the user wishes make a window take up more than 1/2 of the
                                the screen they can drag the window by its divider and drag it along the
                                other window, as if it was "pushing" it. At this point the user can release
                                the window, which will remain in the desired size. This action requires
                                 direct manipulation of the window in the action of dragging the divider to
                                 its new location.</p>

                              when resizing windows. It’s difficult to drag or

                              application should stop allowing the userfrom resizing it any

                              that now the window can only be resized in one

                        takes in a discrete font size input and outputs the
                        resized text at the specified font size. Typical use
                        cases for the form fill-in menu would be if the user
                        need to specify a particular font size, whereas the
                        slider may be used if the user wanted to experiment
                        with quickly viewing the text at different sizes. TextEdit
                        offers three different methods for text resize so that
                        the user can manipulate the text size in a way that makes
                        sense for the user's application.</p>

          <h4>Windows 10 Resizing Instances and Guidelines</h4>
          <p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section will evaluate the implementation of the resize component in the <b>Windows 10</b> platform.   In addition to providing specific examples of resizing, this section will discuss the Windows Guidelines and whether they are accurately reflected in the provided examples.  It is important to note that the Windows Guidelines is a huge collection of documentation, and because this only a handful apply directly to resizing.  Some of the specific sections of the Windows Guidelines that will be referenced are:
            <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742502(v=vs.85).aspx">Windows Window Management</a>,
            <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742499(v=vs.85).aspx">Windows Dialogue Boxes</a>, and
            <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742498(v=vs.85).aspx">Windows Common Dialogues</a>.
            Some of the main concepts that can be pulled from these guideline sections are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Minimum effective window resolution is 800x600 pixels.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Optimal resolution for an effective resizable window is 1024x768 pixels.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Resizable windows no longer require the resize glyph
                  ( <img src="gif/windows10-resize-glyph.jpg"/> ) in the lower
                  right corner of the window.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>The glyph requires a status bar in order to be displayed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Resizable window boarders and resize pointers are more effective
                        at conveying a window is resizable than the glyph.</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>All windows should have a minimize button
                      ( <img src="img/windows10-minimize-button.jpg"/> ) to reduce
                      a window to a taskbar button.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>All windows should have a maximize/restore down button, unless
                        the window isn’t resizable.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p>The maximize button ( <img src="img/windows10-maximize-button.jpg"/> )
                              should make the window full screen, or maximum needed size.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <p>The restore ( <img src="img/windows10-restore-down-button.jpg"/> )
                                down button should restore the window to its previous size.</p>
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>Use resizable windows whenever possible to avoid scroll bars
                              and truncated data.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <p>A minimum window size should be set if the window will no
                                longer be usable at certain dimensions.</p>
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Building on these priciples, here are some specific examples of
                              resizing in Windows 10 with a breif descripton and reflection on
                              their adherence to the Windows Guidelines.</p>
                              <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                                  <div class="thumbnail">
                                    <img src="gif/windows10-automatic-resize.gif" alt="Windows 10 Automatic Resize Gif">
                                    <div class="caption">
                                      <h4>Automatic Resize</h4>
                                      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this example the maximize, restore
                                        down, and minimize buttons are used to manipulate the
                                        dimensions of a Google Chrome window.  When each of these
                                        buttons are clicked, they perform the action specified in
                                        the Windows Guidelines.  Also, complying with Windows
                                        guidelines, whenever the cursor hovers over on of these
                                        buttons a description box appears with the button's name.
                                        This example illustrates automatic resizing because the user
                                        doesn't have to explicitly specify the new dimensions of
                                        the window, but still knows what dimensions the window will
                                        have.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the last example,
                                          automatic resizing, manual resizing requires the user to
                                          explicitly specify the windows size.  While this may be
                                          accomplished through the use of scroll bars, the most common
                                          example of manual resizing in Windows 10 involves clicking
                                          and dragging the window's boarders to the desired width or
                                          height.  The window in this example complies with Windows
                                          guidelines statement that the resize glyph isn't required,
                                          and instead makes the manual resize functionality apparent
                                          through the use of resize pointers that replace the cursor
                                          when it is over the window's bottom and right boarders,
                                          with arrows pointing in the directions of possible change.</p>

                                          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This example of resizing in Windows
                                            10 illustrates both automatic and manual resizing.  For example,
                                            when the user wishes make a window take up 1/2 or 1/4 of the
                                            screen they drag the window by its top boarder and hold it
                                            along the edge of the screen until a box appears showing
                                            the new dimensions of the window.  At this point the user
                                            can release the window, which will fill the projected box.
                                            As mentioned earlier, this action requires direct manipulation
                                            of the window in the action of dragging the window to its new
                                            location, however the projected box takes over the resizing
                                            process once the window has been manipulated into the correct
                                            location.</p>

                                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This example uses Word to illustrate
                                              the resizing of text using a form fill-in.  While this is
                                              a cross platform program, it illustrates the same mechanic
                                              that is present in other Windows 10 programs for resizing
                                              windows and objects.  This type of resizing requires the
                                              user to choose or input their desired size into the form.
                                              Once the form has been submitted the size is updated, and
                                              the user is free to input a new size.  While this process
                                              isn't exactly direct manipulation it still gives users the
                                              ability to quickly change window dimensions, and in some
                                              instances be far more explicit in the new dimensions.</p>

                                                Properties settings window doesn't allow for any resizing.
                                                Any attempts to use the window boarders doesn't work, and
                                                the resize pointers aren't visible.  It seems that this
                                                breaks the Windows guideline that says to use resizable
                                                windows whenever possible.  However, this example adheres
                                                to the Windows guidelines because the window doesn't require
                                                any resizing because the content of the window won't change,
                                                and it is small enough to work on all screens.  Additionally,
                                                this is a Guideline compliant non-resizable window because
                                                it doesn't include nonfunctional minimize or maximize/restore

                                      <p>In this section, the resize component implmentation in the
                                          <b>Mac OSX</b> platform will be specifically evaulated.
                                          Specific examples of resize implementations will be provided,
                                          as well as a discussion of how Apple's interaction design
                                          principles have influenced these specific resize implmentations.
                                          "macOS Human Interface Guidelines" is a document that provides
                                          insight into the theories, principles, and guidelines that Apple
                                          Developers use to design the macOS interface. One guideline that
                                          it states specifically for resize, is that standard document
                                          windows should have transient resize controls--controls that
                                          disappear when not needed. The interface guidelines also
                                          considers the principle of direct manipulation as a way of
                                          affirming the user's mental model of a task, because it can
                                          feel more natural than what they define as "explicit tasks".</p>

                                            <h4>Automatic Resize</h4>
                                            <p>This example shows automatic resize in the Notes Application
                                                Window. Hovering over the colored buttons reveals the resize
                                                symbol, and upon click of the green fullscreen button,
                                                the window fills the entire screen. The fullscreen symbol
                                                is indicative of the function it triggers, because of the
                                                arrows that are pointing outwards. In fullscreen mode,
                                                the entire menu disappears, reflecting the macOS guideline
                                                of transient controls. When the user wants to return to
                                                a non-fullscreen mode, the resize button is accessed by
                                                displaying the menu bar, which returns to the screen when
                                                the mouse is at the top of the screen. Hovering over the
                                                button reveals the resize symbol, which is now arrows that
                                                are pointing inward, indicating that the window will now
                                                shrink upon click. </p>

                                            <p>This example shows manual resize in the Notes Application
                                                Window. Hovering over the permeter of the window changes the
                                                mouse cursor from a pointer to an arrow, which is indicative
                                                of the direction of resize possible at that position. Dragging
                                                the edge of the window at this point allows the user to explore
                                                different window dimensions, befre setting the new dimension on
                                                mouse release. An interesting characteristic to notice is that
                                                resizing the Notes window will cause text wrap to occur, bounded
                                                by the dimensions of the Notes Window. Also, observe how resize
                                                causes the menu bar to add/drop components on stretch/shrink, respectively.
                                                Thus, for some applications in OSX, resize not only acts on the window size
                                                itself, but on a network of interconnected components that will also
                                                react to the resize operation. In this case, as a consequence
                                                of the resize, the menu bar automatically reformats as the window is resized.
                                                Furthermore, the sidebar hides automattically as its parent window is
                                                resizedits there's more room for content.</p>

                                                        a response from the user. Many dialogs—the Print dialog,
                                                        for example—let the user provide several responses
                                                        at once. When a dialog permits resizing, elements
                                                        that can scale with the dialog do so accordingly
                                                        to maintain consistency. In general, views like boxes,
                                                        tab views, and tables, expand to fill the dialog.
                                                        Other elements that aren’t generally resized,

                                                      in this example of a slider that accomplishes resizing the
                                                      dock and its icons by means of a resize slider. The user
                                                      is manipulating the position of the slider to control the
                                                      size of the dock. Although the user is a acting on the
                                                      slider interface element, this is still a form of direct
                                                      manipulation because the impact of the resize action is

                                                      the screen. Also, note that in this example, the slider
                                                      resizes a group of similar elements at the same time.</p>

                                                      when resizing windows. It’s difficult to drag or

                                                      that hides the Dock. For this reason once the user
                                                      reaches the limits of the Dock when resizing, the
                                                      application should stop allowing the userfrom resizing it any
                                                      longer. Feedback is provided to the user by changing
