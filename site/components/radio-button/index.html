		<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>
		<div class="well">
			<p>
				Radio buttons are usually circular in appearance and are accompanied with a text label on the right that describes the given option. They are often accompanied with a series of 
				other radio buttons of which the user can select one in response to a given choice (ex: The question "What is your favorite color?" with the radio buttons being an assortment of different colors). 
			</p>
			<p>
				When inactive, the circles are not colored in, giving it an "empty" look to suggest that it is not currently active. 
				When active, a dot concentric to the circle or an entirely different color to the background color of an empty button "fills" the circle, indicating that it is currently chosen.
			</p>
		</div>
		<br>


		<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>
		<div class="well">
			<p>
				Just like with a general button, a radio button's behavior is solely dependent on whether the user has toggled it. This is usually done by clicking the cursor but also can be done with keyboard inputs.
			</p>
			<p>
				The active/inactive state of a radio button is dependent on the active/inactive state of the other related radio buttons. The active state is exclusive to one radio button in a set at a time (i.e. two radio buttons in the same set cannot be active simultaneously).
			</p>
			<p>Disabled buttons have their circle and/or corresponding text grayed out.</p>
			<p>When accessing via keyboard inputs using the tab button, a radio button is surrounded by a dotted square or border to indicate to the user that it is currently in selection.</p>
		</div>
		<br>

		<h3>Events</h3>
		<div class="container col-md-12 well">
			<ul class="nav nav-tabs nav-justified" role="tablist">
		  	<li role="presentation" class="active" height="100"><a href="#hover" data-toggle="tab" class="nav-selector"> Hover</a></li>
		  	<li role="presentation"><a href="#selected" data-toggle="tab" class="nav-selector"> Selected</a></li>
		  	<li role="presentation"><a href="#clickandhold" data-toggle="tab" class="nav-selector"> Press</a></li>
		  	<li role="presentation"><a href="#clickandrelease" data-toggle="tab" class="nav-selector"> Release</a></li>
		  	<li role="presentation"><a href="#disabled" data-toggle="tab" class="nav-selector"> Disabled</a></li>
			</ul>
			<div class="tab-content">
				<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane active" id="hover">
					<div class="well">
						<br>
						<p>
							When the pointer/cursor is within the area of the circle. In this case, radio buttons either do nothing, or give the user feedback (i.e. cast a shadow within the circle) to indicate that it is ready to be interacted with.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="selected">
					<div class="well">
						<br>
						<p>
							Occurs strictly when user is operating through keyboards input. Pressing the tab key scrolls through all the optional clickables and since radio buttons are grouped together they are always considered one element. To scroll through the choices of radio buttons, the user must use the directional buttons on the keyboard (up and down).
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="clickandhold">
					<div class="well">
						<br>
						<p>
							A user can click on a radio button (pressing within the vicinity of the circle or the label) and prevent it from being toggled by dragging and releasing the cursor away from the vicinity of the cursor. This event cannot occur using keyboard inputs.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="clickandrelease">
					<div class="well">
						<br>
						<p>
							A user can press within the vicinity of the circle or the label and immediately release it to toggle the button. In the context of keyboard inputs, once a button is selected, pressing the enter key is the equivalent of clicking it with a cursor.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="disabled">
					<div class="well">
						<br>
						<p>
							A disabled button provides no response when it is clicked on. Everything remains the same indicating to the user that nothing has changed. Sometimes a cancel icon takes the place of the cursor indicating that it cannot be clicked.
						</p>

							<p><p class="text-center"><img src="http://i60.tinypic.com/k3q00k.png" class="img-responsive center-block" style="max-width: 500px;"></p> Buttons like the picture above that bring down submenus could be considered a variation of a radio button in that only one can be toggled (to expand the submenu) once at a time. However conceptually-speaking, radio buttons focus more on status (ex: the background is red and not blue) rather than actions (ex: pressing a button to access a submenu for background color) so menu buttons are not necessarily identified as a radio button.</p>

				</div>
				
				<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="List-Selection">

						</div>
						<p class="row">This variation presents itself as a list instead of circular buttons. Instead of "filling" in the circle to make a decision, the user clicks on the label itself (usually colored differently when hovered over). Another variation of this is the select box which is like the menu list but requires the user to press a separate select button in order to click their choice.</p>

							<p><p class="text-center"><img src="https://www.cowirrie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/iOSSegmentedControl.png" class="img-responsive center-block"></p>Instead of circles, they are fashioned more like tabs. This is more in the vein of actual physical radio buttons on a radio -- in that it is clear that they belong in the same group but their actions are exclusive from one another. The only fault of these is that they do not allow for much text space on the labels.

		<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
		<div class="well">
			<p>All metrics are important because radio buttons appear quite universally seeing as how interaction with user and system is constant.
			Presenting choices are often in the form of radio buttons.</p>
				<div class="container">
				<h4>Learnability and Memorability</h4>
				<div class="well">
				  Etymologically radio buttons refer to the pop-up buttons on radios used to control its functions. When one button is pressed in, it remained pressed in and the rest popped out.
				  This concept is known even by people with no technological experience. So long as the feedback from system to user is clear, learnability and memorability should be consistently high.
				 </div>
				 <br>

				<h4>Efficiency</h4>
				<div class="well">
					This depends entirely on the layout of the buttons and their distance from one another. However, generally speaking, radio buttons are efficient in presenting choices since it only requires the user to read the labels and click the needed button -- a two-step process.
				</div>
				<br>

				<h4>Errors</h4> 
				<div class="well">
					Like efficiency, this relies on aesthetics and feedback response (see <strong>'Key Characteristics'</strong> for more information). But since learnability and memorability is high, errors should be highly unlikely, especially with clear feedback.
				</div>
				<br>

				<h4>Satisfaction</h4>
				<div class="well">
					Since radio buttons serve a more functional purpose rather than one for enjoyment, satisfaction does not have as much importance as the other metrics.
					But satisfaction can be derived from a straightforward and error-free experience with making choices using radio buttons.
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<br>

		<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
		<div class="well">
			<p>Radio buttons' metrics are entirely dependent on their aesthetics and the system's feedback to the user.
			So it is important that both of these are adjusted to provide the most error-free and least complicated process for the user.
			</p>
			<div class="container">
			<h4>Exclusive</h4>
			<div class="well">
				<p>
					An interesting feature, which can either be advantageous or detrimental depending on the argument, is that radio buttons cannot be rendered inactive ("turned off") without having to render another button active ("turned on").
					This can be advantageous if the system absolutely requires the user to make a choice no matter what. But this can be detrimental if making a choice is not necessary and the user will have to reset the screen so as to clear the changes.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h4>Interactive</h4>
			<div class="well">
				<p>Button should toggle upon clicking within the vicinity of the circle and the accompanying label itself.</p>
			</div>

			<h4>Distinct</h4>
			<div class="well">
				<p>If there are multiple radio buttons in different categories in the same screen, they should be clearly separated in their respective groups with either a border, line break, or label. If necessary, they must be put into a separate screen.</p>
			</div>

	<!-- 		<li><code>disabled</code> buttons should have their circles and labels be grayed out or at least a shade lighter than the default font color of a non-disabled button.</li>
			<li>There should be a clear difference between the outer circle and its inner concentric circle (active vs inactive button) to explicitly indicate whether or not it is "filled" or "empty".</li> -->
		
			
			<h4>Feedback</h4>
			<div class="well">
				<p>It should always be clear whether or not a button is in its active state or not. Additionally, the toggling of both the button pressed and the button deactivated should be clear, and every set of radio buttons should be clearly distinct from any other set.</p>
				<h5>On Actions</h5>
				<div class="container">
					<p><b>Press:</b> The toggling of both the button pressed and the button deactivated (if any) should be clear.</p>
					<p><b>Hover:</b> It is up to the developer to give feedback when hovering, though the look of the hover should be distinct from active, inactive, and disabled.</p>
					<p><b>Disabled:</b> The button should be made to not stand out as much as enabled buttons. Additionally, the mouse cursor can change to more clearly show the disabled state.</p>
					<p><b>Click:</b> The button should show that it has been clicked, but not look as though it is in its active state.</p>
					<p><b>Release:</b> If released outside of the button, the radio button should remain inactive, and if released over the button then it should become active.</p>
					</div>

        <p>Radio buttons for this platform function similarly to the typical radio button. Its marked difference from previous OSX versions is its aesthetics.
					As seen from the picture below, the colors for the radio buttons are flatter and brighter with less highlighting and shadow, a brighter blue and more emphasis on white.

        	Microsoft sets some strict guidelines on the use of radio buttons. First and most importantly, radio buttons should only be used with two or mutually exclusive options.  They should be used in  the place of a drop down list when most or all of the options are important enough to take up screen space.  In instances where the default option will be selected by the majority of users than you should use a drop-down menu instead.  In general, there is not much difference between Windows 10 radio buttons and others, although Windows does make the choice to change the cursor to indicate hovering over the button as opposed to affecting the button itself.
        	
        	<div class="container">
        	<div class="col-sm-6">
	        	<p class="text-center"><img src="W10example.png" width="50%"></p>

        	  This image shows the design of Windows 10 radio buttons.  The selected button is shown by changing the color of the outer circle, and filling the concentric circle with black.  These colors can be changed.  Also note that each button's description is only one line long and uses sentence case.  You can also see drop-down lists being used for less impactful features.
        	</div>

        	<div class="col-sm-6">
	        	<p class="text-center"><img src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/images/radio-button-groups.png"></p>

	        	This image shows a desired way to seperate radio buttons.  The different labels make it clear that the two sets are distinct, and that selecting from Background will not affect BorderBrush.  Microsoft makes it clear that a developer must distinct different sets of buttons, as the mutually exclusive nature is prone to errors if the mental model of the user does not match the system image.

      <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="gnome-3">
      	<br>
      	<p>In the GNOME Human Interaction Guidelines, a radio button is defined as, "Radio buttons are used in groups to select from a mutually exclusive set of options. Only one radio button within a group may be set at any one time. As with check boxes, do not use radio buttons to initiate actions." Notable things mentioned in the GNOME HIG for radio buttons include to place the radio buttons directly to the left of anything they are immediatley affecting, using sentence capatilization for the button labels, setting an access key in the label allowing for selection from keyboard, not to place more than eight radio buttons in the same grouping, and to align them vertically.</p>
		    <p>The GNOME Radio Buttons also includes a mixed state. This is used in situations when the radio buttons are in a multiselection grouping. Which, is against the idea of a radio button for most platforms.</p>
		    <p class="text-center"><img src=radio-buttons.svg alt="GNOME Radio Buttons"><img src=radio-group.png alt="GNOME Radio Button Group"></p>
		    <p>These two images show examples of GNOME Radio Buttons, the left is found in the GNOME HIG and the right is found in the GTK+ API documentation. The model on the left has the current and modern design of GNOME included in GNOME 3 and includes a button in it's mixed state, where as the left is likely an example from GNOME 2.</p>

      </div>
      <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="Ubuntu">
      	<br>
      	<p>In the Ubuntu Design Guidelines, the developers state that they believe radio buttons should be placed to the left of its corresponding label, with a 5px space between the input field and the label. The input field should align vertically with the preceding and subsequent input fields. Ubuntu's developers also took a more minimalistic approach, stating that ideally, radio buttons should use default browser styling. </p>

      	<div class="container">
        	<div class="col-sm-6">
	        	<p class="text-center"><img src="http://design.ubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/ubuntu-guidelines-web-forms-input-types.gif"></p>

        	  	<p>Note the 5px gap between label and button, and the basic styling. Ubuntu believes the only deviations in style should be when they enhance usability and don’t hamper accessibility.</p>
