      <p>Welcome to the website of the Paradixm project. This site aims to provide a no-holds-barred catalog
        of user interface elements, designs, and behaviors across platforms and across time.</p>

      <p>The long-term goal of the Paradixm project is to serve as the basis for a broad-based, best-of-breed
        user interface vision that can accommodate users of all levels of proficiency as well as devices with
        varying display and interaction technologies. The very feasibility of this goal remains to be seen,
        but we have to start somewhere, right?</p>
