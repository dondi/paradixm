<p class="lead">The gateway to knowledge at your fingertips, the Login/Unlock screen for Windows 7 and OS X is the gate to the wonders of computers.</p>

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

  <blockquote>The Login/Unlock screen is possibly the most common attritube to any computer, Windows, Mac, Linux, etc. While the aesthetics may change from platform to platform, the same idea and function is prevalent in all platforms. Each screen has a number of possible users that can be accessed via passwords. Both screens have the options to shut down or restart the system as well.</blockquote>

  <blockquote> Both platforms do not vary when it comes to login. Each requires the user to pick a domain and enter the domain's password. For Windows 7, if the wrong password is typed in, the login screen doesn't change and asks the user for another password. Depending on the settings, the user may allow for hints or, if installed, use the fingerprint scanner. </blockquote>
  <blockquote>For OS X, if the user types in the wrong password, the domain image will vibrate and ask for the password again. If the user gets the password wrong three times, OS X will go into sleep mode. The user may change these options such as adding more tries for the password or adding hints for the correct password. In addition if the caps lock is on for either platform, their will be a notifcation. Windows 7 will specifically tell you on the screen while OS X will show a greyed out image. Both platforms provide buttons to enter the password after it has been typed. (See Button page for more information about buttons).</blockquote>

<h3> Priority Metrics <h3>
    <blockquote>The Login/Unlock screen is used by almost every interface available today and uses all five metrics to an extent. The usability metrics that affect this the most are Learnability, Efficency, Error. Users must be able to recognize and understand how to login into his or her computer or else will not be able to use it (Learnability). Login/Unlock must be efficient so the user does not have to wait to use the computer (Efficency). Users should never make an error of using the wrong domain or typing in the wrong password. This would delay and dissatisfy the user (Errors). 
      <br> </br>
      Satisfaction and Memorability affect Login/Unlock screens the least. To login or unlock the screen should be quick, lack of errors, and efficient which leads to satisfaction (Satisfaction). The user must memorize which domain goes with which password so as to not make errors (Errors). 
      <br> </br>
      Overall, the Login/Unlock screen is rarely used outside of security measures and relies mostly on Learnability, Efficency, and Errors.

<h3> Variants </h3> 
  <blockquote> For Windows 7, some computer have the option for a fingerprint scanner. A fingerprint scanner allows the user to suplement their fingerprint as a password by swiping their selected finger onto the scanner. As such, both the fingerprint and password for each user can be used to unlock the computer. <br> </br>
  OS X does not have this feature. Also, across all platforms and websites, the same steps are taken except that some websites require a security question to login.<br> </br>
  A picture of the scanner can be found below.</blockquote>

<h3> Key Characteristics <h3>
  <blockquote> The Unlock/Login screen allows selection and provides an easy, spaced out layout for the different domains. It becomes easy to navigate and zooms in when a domain is selected. At the Unlock window, it provides examples and intuitive instructions. 
    <br> </br>
    Windows 7's design uses colors effectively by invoking the pleasing aeshtic of their backgrounds, following their guidelines. It provides easy to read icons that make using the Login/Unlock screen easy to navigate.
    <br> </br>
    OS X's design follows uses clear and precise languge as well as clear UI content so the screen isn't cluttered or hard to follow. The guidelines are specifically followed by making the interface the main point instead of aesthetic.</blockquote>
    <h3> Feedback <h3> 
    <blockquote>When the button is pressed, it provides feedback by comprehensively showing that the computer is being unlocked by taking away the unlock screen. It replaces the screen with a different screen and unlocks the computer if its works otherwise it will return to the unlock screen.</blockquote>
<h3> Summary of History of Control Alt Delete </h3>
<blockquote> David Bradley helped build IBM’s new personal computer. Yet, when the computer encountered a glitch, then they had to manually restart the system. So Bradley created a keyboard shortcut ctrl + alt + del that triggered a system reset.<br> </br>
The reason why those three keys were chosen was due to their placement since it wasn’t likely for all three keys to be pressed at the same time on accident. <br> </br>
 Although Bradley had created the shortcut to save time and help his fellow programmers, it was never intended for the customers. However, it wasn’t until much later on that Bradley’s shortcut became well-known. </blockquote>
